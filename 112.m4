<p>I've been <a href='http://diveintomark.org/archives/2008/06/21/minimalism'>inspired</a> 
to take a more minimalist approach with the design of this site.</p>

<p>Most obvious is the reduction of <a
href='http://tomayko.com/writings/administrative-debris'>administrative
debris</a>, though I think the new typographical choices also
improve readability. There were things in the old design that I
added because "all blogs need them" that in retrospect feel
superfluous. As a bonus, the site is far easier to read in
non-graphical user agents.</p>

<p>I was suprised how well I like the all-in-one <a
href='/list'>archive page</a> that Pilgrim suggests, though I will
probably like it more once it gets broken up by month. It also needs
to be more discoverable. I still haven't figured out if I'm going to
add back in a search box or blogroll somehow, but I'll definitely
be putting the comment form back up soon.</p>

<p>One thing I wanted to add that didn't make it into the design is
a photo of myself. It seems vain, but after attending a few
conferences and noticing how easy it was to recognize other people
who do the same and <a
href='http://twitter.com/gilesgoatboy/statuses/825666128'>going
unrecognized myself</a>, it made me realize that facial-recognition
is pretty valuable. Still, I hate to sully the purity of this
textual layout.</p>

<p>On a related note, I added in those nifty <code>&lt;link
rel="next/prev" [...]&gt;</code> tags into the header of each
page. Unfortunately if you're using Firefox you'll need <a
href='https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2933'>an
extension</a> to make use of them, but <a
href='http://conkeror.org'>Conkeror</a>'s got support built in bound
to a double-press of the square bracket keys. It's remarkable what a
difference little bits of extra metadata can make once you've got
them integrated into your browsing habits.</p>

<p><b>Update</b>: tried browsing the site in Firefox for a while
without the prev/next links in chrome... it's a pain. So I added in
hyperlinks for now. But it wouldn't hurt to <a
href='https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=291340'>petition
browser creators</a> to expose this juicy bit of metadata instead of
just throwing it away.</p>
