<p>I've just written a new Emacs mode for Rails development. I know there's already a <a href='https://opensvn.csie.org/mvision/emacs/.emacs.d/rails.el'> rails.el</a>,  but it seemed like too much for me. For one thing,  it assumes you're going to be using mmm-mode. In my experience,  mmm-mode is a huge pain. If you make changes to a buffer,  you have to manually re-parse the buffer to get the syntax highlighting to reflect your changes. It also assumes any ruby files you're editing are  going to use rails mode,  which is absolutely unacceptable.</p> <p>So I scratched an itch:  <a href='http://dev.technomancy.us/phil/wiki/arorem'>arorem</a>  is Another Ruby on Rails Emacs Mode. It's much leaner than rails.el,  skipping out on a lot of the stuff I don't use at all. (webrick management and documentation search,  for instance.) It's got a dedicated rhtml major mode rather than trying to mix major modes on the fly via mmm-mode. Anyhow,  more details are available <a href='http://dev.technomancy.us/phil/wiki/arorem'>on my trac</a>. I'm very interested in seeing what other people think of this as it's my first nontrivial piece of elisp,  so if you have anything to say please edit the wiki or <a href='http://dev.technomancy.us/phil/newticket'>file a ticket</a>.</p>
