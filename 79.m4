<p>Somehow I'm getting a wifi signal in LAX,  so I'll be able to remedy
  the fact that I wasn't able to get a post in before I took off. As I
  <a href='http://philisha.net/2007/03/big-news/'>mentioned on my
  other blog</a>,  A and I are heading off to Indonesia for a
  month. I'll be doing training and setup with GNU/Linux,  Ruby,  and
  other Free Software at a small software development shop in Central Java.</p>

<p>Before I left I had a bit more Javascript fun. My brother-in-law
  <a href='http://www.birdsofyore.com'>Loren Broach</a> came up with a
  game that I coded up. You
  can <a href='http://technomancy.us/code/monolith/index.html'>play it
  in your browser</a> if you want. I haven't done game programming in
  a while; that was a lot of fun. I haven't done GUI programming in a
  while; that aspect was only fun because it was so simple. The cool
  thing about it is that first I wrote it the way I normally write
  Javascript,  which is fairly procedural (and accordingly,  somewhat
  brain-dead). I got it working,  but then I rewrote it using
  Javascript's object-oriented prototype system. It was a fairly
  interesting exercise. I don't think anyone would defend procedural
  JS as a good way to write nontrivial software,  but I've only used it
  for fairly easy stuff in the past barring my few patches to
  Conkeror. This project really opened my eyes to see how you can use
  Javascript in a way that can scale in terms of readability and
  maintainability beyond the couple-page uses that I've had for it so
  far. I'm still on the fence as to whether I prefer Javascript's
  style of OO to the more conventional model. It really feels like
  you're just tossing around eigenclasses the whole time,  which takes
  some getting used to. It also resembles the OO system that Paul
  Graham implements in one of the appendices of his <i>ANSI Common
  Lisp</i> book. Anyway,  it's always fun to play with a new way of
  thinking.</p>

<p>We <a href='http://philisha.net/2007/04/staging/'>cleared out our
  apartment</a> before we left,  so my server had to be moved to
  A's parents' house. A 311-day uptime isn't too unusual these
  days (especially with a UPS),  but I was disappointed to start from
  scratch again. Unfortunately A's parents' ISP is pulling some
  dirty moves and blocking all the interesting ports,  so I've had to
  move everything I can over to my account
  on <a href='http://dreamhost.com'>Dreamhost</a> in the mean time. I
  haven't been able to get Trac moved over; according to the Dreamhost
  wiki it's a fairly complex task. That means
  the <a href='http://dev.technomancy.us: 8080/conkeror'>Conkeror
  Trac</a> is only available on port 8080... sorry guys! I'll try to
  remedy that when I get the chance.</p>
