<p>If you're on GNOME, you should try the <a href='http://raphael.slinckx.net/deskbar/'>Deskbar Applet</a>. Seriously,  it is pretty slick. </p> <img src='/i/deskbar.png' alt='nifty' title='quicksilver... get over it.' style='border:  0;' /> <p>Basically it makes searching and launching pretty effortless. Stuff that's already easy gets easier. Everyone wins! (Plus good plugin support for future excitement. Do I smell RDoc?)</p>
