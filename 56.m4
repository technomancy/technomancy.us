<p>It's time for another linkfest!</a>

<ul>
  <li>Someone figured out how
    to <a
    href='http://squeedlyspooch.com/blog/archives/002069.html'>correlate
    GPS data with F-spot photos</a> via timestamps and dump it in to
    Google maps. (This would be a good excuse to get a GPS.)</li>

  <li>The <a
  href='http://blog.caboo.se/pages/documentation_drive'>Caboose
  Documentation Drive</a> has raised a staggering $15, 227.74 to go
  towards improving the Rails documentation. All this was raised in
  three days from 94 contributors. If you make money with Rails,  you
  ought to pitch in!</li>

  <li><a href='http://magicmodels.rubyforge.org/'>Dr. Nic's Magic
  Models</a> takes the DRY principle to frightening lengths. Why
  specify your associations/validations in the model when it's already
  explained in the migration? (I'd be interested in the plausibility
  of going the other direction since it seems more sane,  but it's
    rather problematic.)</li>

  <li>Kevin
  Clark <a
  href='http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/08/07/why-fixtures-suck-and-how-we-can-fix-them'>muses
  over what can be done to improve test fixtures</a> in Rails. The
  fact that most of the people on the core panel admitted to not using
  fixtures is a pretty good indicator that something's wrong
  here. I'll admit I've had my share of pain with the brittleness of
  fixtures,  but I haven't really taken it to heart. Pain is code's way
    of telling you that something needs improvement.</li>

  <li>Lastly,  here's
  a <a
  href='http://www.ex-parrot.com/%7Epete/upside-down-ternet.html'>neat
  trick you can play on people who start mooching your
      bandwidth</a>. Much fun.</li>
