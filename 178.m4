<p>Everyone asks what it's like to live here in Thailand on the
  border. "Great, and weird" is how I like to sum it up&mdash;the
  country
  is <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/technomancy/19658530230">beautiful</a>;
  the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/technomancy/20907191594/">food
  is ridiculously good</a> and cheap enough to eat out every day;
  there's
  always <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/technomancy/19489921493">something
  fun to do around</a>; great! Most people think the "weird" part
  comes from maybe
  the <a href="http://diythegoodlife.com/2015/12/02/spirited-away-in-thailand/">animist
  spirit houses</a> everywhere, or the stalls serving fried crickets
  and grubs at the night market, or finding snails climbing up the
  inside of your kitchen pipes and poking up into your sink,
  or <a href="http://livingintoeventually.blogspot.com/2015/10/burmese-fermented-tea-leaf-salad.html">salad
  made out of fermented tea leaves</a>? But no; all that stuff becomes everyday
  eventually. What's much harder to come to grips with is just being
  here, living a life of relative ease, and not knowing how to help
  the people around you who are going
  through <a href="http://livingintoeventually.blogspot.com/2015/06/processing.html">difficulties
  you have a hard time even wrapping your head around</a>.</p>

<p>The Charis Project, which we are working under, doesn't really
  have projects for which it makes sense for me to be directly involved
  right now, so I have been looking for other ways to help out in, mostly
  the field of education. I began with trying to start a string of
  small projects on my own, but each of them so far has fizzled out
  or not gotten off the ground to begin with. I've heard from others
  with more field experience that long-term volunteers should expect
  it to take a while before they are really effective here.</p>

<p>There is a pattern of westerners naively coming in and thinking
  that they can dive right in
  and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/06/04/technology-wont-fix-americas-neediest-schools-it-makes-bad-education-worse/">contribute
  without understanding the context</a>, and this often results in
  projects that end up abandoned after a year or so because there
  was no buy-in from the people they were intended to help. In order
  to avoid this I've come to the conclusion that it makes much more
  sense to partner with and learn from some of the larger
  organizations who have been involved in that kind of work here for
  a long time instead of trying to kick off my own thing right off
  the bat. What works, what doesn't?  What communities are
  receptive? What context am I dropping into the middle of
  unawares?</p>

<p>So that's been where I've been focusing more recently. It's a
  little rough to have come this far without more to show, but the
  language-learning front has proceeded better, and that is always
  time well-spent. Here's to seeing what year two brings.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b> I moved back to the US with my family in late 2016
  to live in Washington state.</p>
