  <p>It's time for another linkfest!</a>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Someone figured out how
      to <a
      href='http://squeedlyspooch.com/blog/archives/002069.html'>correlate
      GPS data with F-spot photos</a> via timestamps and dump it in to
      Google maps. (This would be a good excuse to get a GPS.</li>
  
    <li>The <a
    href='http://blog.caboo.se/pages/documentation_drive'>Caboose
    Documentation Drive</a> has raised a staggering $15, 227.74 to go
    towards improving the Rails documentation. All this was raised in
    three days from 94 contributors. If you make money with Rails,  you
    ought to pitch in!</li>
  
    <li><a href='http://magicmodels.rubyforge.org/'>Dr. Nic's Magic
    Models</a> takes the DRY principle to frightening lengths. Why
    specify your associations/validations in the model when it's already
    explained in the migration? (I'd be interested in the plausibility
    of going the other direction since it seems more sane,  but it's
      rather problematic.)</li>
  
    <li>Kevin
    Clark <a
    href='http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/08/07/why-fixtures-suck-and-how-we-can-fix-them'>muses
    over what can be done to improve test fixtures</a> in Rails. The
    fact that most of the people on the core panel admitted to not using
    fixtures is a pretty good indicator that something's wrong
    here. I'll admit I've had my share of pain with the brittleness of
    fixtures,  but I haven't really taken it to heart. Pain is code's way
      of telling you that something needs improvement.</li>
  
    <li>Lastly,  here's
    a <a
    href='http://www.ex-parrot.com/%7Epete/upside-down-ternet.html'>neat
    trick you can play on people who start mooching your
        bandwidth</a>. Much fun.</li>
