  <p>So you might be wondering "what the deuce is technomancy up to
    these days anyway; he seems to be all over the place". Or you
    might be not wondering that, but if you were, you'd have a
    great point. I'm not doing much Clojure these days, there's just a
    smattering of Racket going on, and I'm not doing all that much
    Erlang either.</p>

  <p>Well, this post isn't much about code, but perhaps you'll indulge
    me a bit all the same. My wife and I always had the idea that we
    would move overseas at some point. I grew up in Indonesia and
    Singapore, and her father was raised in Ecuador. We didn't really
    have a clear idea of what this would look like, but as 2014 began
    we started to look more seriously.</p>

  <p>This past June, my wife and I traveled to Thailand for a few
    weeks in order to meet up with a few organizations working
    specifically with Burmese affected by
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_conflict_in_Burma">long-running
    civil war</a>
    and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Burma">rampant
    human rights abuses</a>. We spent some time
    in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiang_Mai">Chiang
    Mai</a>[<a href="#fn1">1</a>] but then headed down
    to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mae_Sot">Mae Sot</a> on
    the Burmese border. While we were down there we stayed with folks
    from <a href="http://thecharisproject.org">the Charis project</a>
    and got to hear stories of their efforts to lift migrant families
    in the area out of poverty.</p>

  <p>So often you see western aid framed in terms of Americans coming
    in with their money to save the day, (it's less often you hear
    about <a href="http://aswwu.com/collegian/voluntourism-more-harm-than-good/">ways
    in which this backfires and contributes to a cycle of
    dependence</a>) but we could clearly see that wasn't what was
    happening here. The Charis Project possessed a bold and compelling
    vision for breaking the cycle of poverty by empowering whole
    families to be self-sustaining, and they had an impressive track
    record when it came to pulling it off.</p>

  <p>I could tell you some of the stories we heard from them, but they
      <a href="http://www.shelaughsatthedays.net/2014/07/we-are-small.html">do</a> <a href="http://www.shelaughsatthedays.net/2014/04/an-embarrassment-of-riches.html">it</a>
      so
      <a href="http://insearchofashamelessgospel.blogspot.com/2014/04/what-are-we-going-to-do-tonight-brain.html">much</a>
      <a href="http://www.shelaughsatthedays.net/2014/01/of-beggars-and-boys-and-becoming-men.html">better</a>.</p>

  <p>Yesterday I quit my fantastic job of three years at Heroku, and
    I'm planning on moving with my family to Thailand next month to
    partner with them.</p>

  <p>It isn't clear yet exactly what our role will be there. If it
    ends up to be working with technology somehow (likely in the form
    of education?) then that would be great, but I've gotten over
    myself and will be content even if not. I've learned a lot about
    selflessness and helping others through my friends and church the
    last few years. I almost feel embarassed that it took me to the
    point where I had everything in my own life put together before I
    could really take the time to think seriously about what I could
    do to help those around me. But it feels like the only response I
    could have as I reflect on how blessed my own life has been and
    when I read about the situations some of these people are living
    in.</p>

  <p>So the current plan is to fly over in the middle of January. I
    plan on spending a portion of my time doing
    consulting[<a href="#fn2">2</a>], but since the cost of living is
    dramatically lower in Mae Sot than in the United States, my hope
    is that this will still leave me with a significant amount of time
    to work with Charis. In addition, I want to continue to
    run <a href="http://atreus.technomancy.us">my custom keyboard
    business</a> selling kits. 10% of proceeds will go directly to
    poverty-alleviation projects, and the rest will go to supporting
    my family; if interest remains strong it may allow me to focus
    more and spend less time consulting.</p>

  <p>But you don't need to buy a keyboard to contribute to the work
    going on there. Again, they've said it
    better <a href="http://thecharisproject.org/partners/">on their
    blog</a> than I could, but it's remarkable how great an impact you
    can have with donations that can seem so small from a western
    lifestyle
    perspective. Please <a href="http://thecharisproject.org/donate/">consider
    giving</a> to support their life-changing projects.</p>

  <p>I'll be posting updates as things progress. We anticipate we will
    spend a while focused mostly on learning the language, culture,
    and just figuring out life. We're all very excited to move into
    this next phase.</p>

  <p>[<a name="fn1">1</a>] I may have talked to some of you in the
    past about working in Chiang Mai for another organization. Both
    organizations are doing fantastic work I greatly respect. It's a
    long story, but we realized not too long ago that if we really
    wanted our whole family to be involved, Chiang Mai and the work we
    had planned there wasn't the way to go about it.</p>

  <p>[<a name="fn2">2</a>] Spending the last five years working
    remotely has helped prepare me for an arrangement like this,
    though the time zones will be a new challenge for me.</p>
