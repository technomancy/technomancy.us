  <p>I'm very proud to announce the release of my latest
    project, <a href='http://peepcode.com/products/functional-programming-with-clojure'>Functional
    Programming with Clojure</a>,
    a <a href='http://peepcode.com'>PeepCode</a> screencast created
    with <a href='http://topfunky.com'>Geoffrey Grosenbach</a>. We
    were lucky to have Rich Hickey, the creator of Clojure do the
    technical review.</p>

  <p>I've <a href='/121'>blogged</a> about <a href='/122'>Clojure</a>
    before. It's becoming clear that with the way multi-core systems
    are becoming the norm, functional programming provides tools to
    handle concurrency in a straightforward way. Languages like
    Haskell and Erlang are experiencing surges in popularity, but
    Clojure brings some <a
    href='http://constc.blogspot.com/2009/03/relativity-of-simultaneity.html'>great
    new tricks</a> of its own to the table. Part of this is its
    heritage as part of the Lisp family of languages, part of it is
    being built on a really solid virtual machine, and part of it is
    Rich's ingenuity that shines in its design.</p>

  <p>If you've been wanting to dive into Clojure, this is a great way
    to get started quickly. The screencast steps through the development
    of <a href='http://github.com/technomancy/mire'>Mire</a>, a
    multiplayer text adventure. I found this to be an fitting
    project to showcase Clojure's strengths since it involves
    concurrent processing while still requiring state to be shared
    between threads, and it's simple enough to cover in an hour.</p>

  <p>So take a look! I think
    you'll <a href='http://search.twitter.com/search?q=clojure+peepcode'>like</a>
    it.</p>
