title: in which a tool helps with relaxation

  <p>I've been experimenting a bit
  with <a href='http://couchdb.apache.org'>CouchDB</a> recently. I've
  been really impressed with how quickly it lets you get started;
  interacting with it always feels <i>obvious</i>. I've spent enough
  time doing web apps to get tired of how everyone always jumps
  straight to the unholy combination of a relational database system
  and object-relational mapper whenever they need any
  persistence. (When all you have is a hammer...) So using CouchDB
  with a functional language is a breath of fresh air.</p>

  <p>Putting together a CouchDB adapter in Clojure is really a matter
  of no more than a page worth of code once you've got
  an <a href='http://github.com/technomancy/clojure-http-client'>HTTP
  client</a>, so it's left as an exercise to the reader. Since
  functional languages encourage working closer to your core data
  types (which have clear mappings to JSON) there's very little
  cognitive overhead when it comes to using Couch for persistence.</p>

  <p>Last week while I was in Portland I put together a client written
  in Elisp <a href='http://github.com/technomancy/relax.el'>called
  relax.el</a>. This lets you browse Couch databases from the comfort
  of Emacs. It also lets you edit documents straight from an Emacs
  buffer, which is much more convenient than using the browser's text
  tools from Futon.</p>

  <p>There are a few quirks with regard to pagination, (just press
  <kbd>g</kbd> if it gets messed up) but it's pretty useful as it
  is. It should be in <a href='http://tromey.com/elpa'>ELPA</a> soon,
  so <kbd>M-x knock-yourself-out</kbd>.</p>
