  <p>Considering the number
    of <a
    href="http: //sztywny.titaniumhosting.com/2006/07/23/stiff-asks-great-programmers-answers/">agile
    folk who use emacs</a>,  it's pretty surprising how difficult it is
    to find code for automated testing of elisp. There's plenty of stuff
    for <a
    href="http: //www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/emacs/unit-test.el">running
    tests in other languages</a>,  but I was only able to find <a href='http: //www.panix.com/~tehom/my-code/regress.el'>one Emacs
    Lisp specific testing library</a>.</p>
  
  <p>Unfortunately as I look at the internals of regress.el,  it's clear
    that it's written by someone very unfamiliar with everyday Lisp
    idioms: </p>
  
    <pre>
      (<span class="keyword">while</span> suites
        (setq suite (car suites)
              suites (cdr suites))
        (<span class="keyword">if</span> (and (car suite) (not (stringp (car suite))))
            (setq description <span class="string">"Untitled test suite"</span>)
          (setq description (car suite)
                suite (cdr suite)))
    </pre>
  
  <p>Apparently the map function is unfamiliar to the author. It's
    strange,  because this is a <i>really useful</i> library. It works
    very well,  and it's quite well documented. (It was well-tested,  go
    figure.)  I've made a few improvements to it so the test results are
    more readable,  but I'm thinking I might just want to rewrite it.
    This is partially because the internals <i>are</i> so bad,  partially
    to make it more xUnit-ish and focused on TDD rather than regression
    testing,  and partially just because it would be a good exercise in
    emacs lisp.</p>
  
  <p>We'll see how that goes. It should be fun,  but it may be foolish to
    put off improving Rails support for the time that this will take to
    implement. Then again,  if my past experiences with elisp are any
    indication,  this will take a lot less time than it would seem like
    it should up front. Also,  having this in place while writing the
    Rails support modes would probably smooth things along quite a
    bit.</p>
  
  <p>Speaking of Rails support,  I've
    improved <a
  	      href="http: //dev.technomancy.us/phil/browser/dotfiles/.emacs.d/arorem2/rhtml-mode.el">RHTML-mode</a>
    rather significantly in the past few days. There is still
    one <a href="http: //dev.technomancy.us/phil/ticket/216">immensely
    irritating bug</a> that is getting in the way,  but on the whole it's
    coming along quite nicely.</p>
  
  <p>On an unrelated note,  I came across this little gem about how in an
    unprecedented move,  the Department of Homeland Security has deemed
    an entire state of matter to be a national security risk: </p>
