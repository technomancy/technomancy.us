  <p>I just got back last week from
    the <a href="https://thestrangeloop.com/">Strange Loop
    conference</a> in St. Louis. The conference showcased some really
    quality keynotes and session talks, but I had been invited to give
    a workshop teaching Emacs, which was a blast. The workshop was
    three hours long, but I still felt like I was zooming
    through. <a href="http://p.hagelb.org/getting-cozy-with-emacs.org.html">My
    outline</a> is available, though it may not be all that useful
    unless you were there.</p>

  <p>The talk focused on the task of crafting your own set of
    dotfiles. Naturally I did talk some about
    the <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit">Emacs
    Starter Kit</a>, though my approach there has changed fairly
    radically. I've been developing version 2 of the Starter Kit
    since the beginning of the summer, but now I think it's time to
    make the release official and give it wider exposure.</p>

  <h4>The Emacs Starter Kit, version 2</h4>

  <p>Version 2 of the Starter Kit turns things inside out. The
    original version was very prescriptive; you used it by cloning a
    git repo to use as your entire <tt>~/.emacs.d</tt> directory, and
    you fit your own customizations inside the structure it
    provided. This was mostly due to the fact that when it was
    released the packaging story for elisp was very immature. Use of
    package.el was not very widespread, so the Starter Kit had to
    include a copy as well as bundle a bunch of libraries that had not
    been packaged yet. As it turned out, I think the Starter Kit had a
    role in helping popularize package.el.</p>

  <p>A lot has changed since 2008&mdash;primarily
    that <a href="/133">package.el has been included in Emacs</a> and
    <a href="http://marmalade-repo.org">Marmalade</a>
    has <a href="/144">picked up lots of steam</a>, becoming the
    de-facto community package source with over 250 packages. It's now
    feasible for the Starter Kit to be distributed as just another
    package, leaving you free to structure your dotfiles however you
    like. All it takes is setting yourself up to get packages from
    Marmalade:</p>

  <pre class="code"><span class="esk-paren">(</span><span class="keyword">require</span> '<span class="constant">package</span><span class="esk-paren">)</span>
  <span class="esk-paren">(</span>add-to-list 'package-archives
               '<span class="esk-paren">(</span><span class="string">"marmalade"</span> . <span class="string">"http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"</span><span class="esk-paren">))</span>
  <span class="esk-paren">(</span>package-initialize<span class="esk-paren">)</span></pre>

  <img src="/i/langley-rocket.jpg" alt="rocket, man" align="left" />

  <p>Place that in <tt>~/.emacs.d/init.el</tt> and evaluate it with
    <kbd>M-x eval-buffer</kbd>. From there you can run <kbd>M-x
    package-refresh-contents</kbd> to pull in the latest package lists
    (analogous to <kbd>apt-get update</kbd>) followed by <kbd>M-x
    package-install starter-kit</kbd>. And then you're set.</p>

  <p>However, it's unlikely that the starter-kit is the only package
    you're interested in. Rather than picking packages by hand, I'm a
    fan of keeping a list of all the packages you use in your
    dotfiles. That way when you move to a new machine, you won't have
    to remember what packages you've come to depend upon; checking out
    your dotfiles on a new machine will pull in everything you've
    specified. Here's my list along with some code to handle it:</p>

  <pre class="code"><span class="esk-paren">(</span><span class="keyword">when</span> <span class="esk-paren">(</span>not package-archive-contents<span class="esk-paren">)</span>
    <span class="esk-paren">(</span>package-refresh-contents<span class="esk-paren">))</span>

  <span class="esk-paren">(</span><span class="keyword">defvar</span> <span class="variable-name">my-packages</span> '<span class="esk-paren">(</span>starter-kit starter-kit-lisp starter-kit-eshell
                                    starter-kit-bindings scpaste
                                    clojure-mode clojure-test-mode
                                    markdown-mode yaml-mode tuareg
                                    marmalade oddmuse scpaste<span class="esk-paren">))</span>

  <span class="esk-paren">(</span><span class="keyword">dolist</span> <span class="esk-paren">(</span>p my-packages<span class="esk-paren">)</span>
    <span class="esk-paren">(</span><span class="keyword">when</span> <span class="esk-paren">(</span>not <span class="esk-paren">(</span>package-installed-p p<span class="esk-paren">))</span>
      <span class="esk-paren">(</span>package-install p<span class="esk-paren">)))</span></pre>

  <h4>What's Changed</h4>

  <p>Being a 2.0 release, you can't expect 100% backwards compatibility
    with the old Starter Kit. In particular, it is much more
    modular. The base of the Starter Kit simply gives you better
    default settings and a few new commands. There are separate
    modules supporting various languages like Ruby, Lisp (Clojure,
    Emacs Lisp, Scheme, and Common Lisp), and Javascript, though right
    now the Lisp one is the most polished. If anyone is interested in
    helping maintain alternate language modules, please contact
    me <a href="https://github.com/technomancy">on
    Github</a>. Key bindings have also been spun out into their own module
    since they don't follow Emacs binding conventions strictly.</p>

  <p>There is also no more <tt>elpa-to-submit</tt> directory; if you
    rely on packages that aren't on Marmalade yet, it's up to you to
    either check them into your own dotfiles or better yet upload them
    yourself. There's also no more explicit <tt>recentf</tt> support
    since a new feature called <tt>ido-use-virtual-buffers</tt> allows
    recent files to show up in the regular <kbd>C-x b</kbd> buffer
    switcher, simplifying things. The addition of
    the <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/ido-ubiquitous">ido-ubiquitous</a>
    package makes it so regular completion gets enhanced with ido
    magic, so functionality like <tt>ido-imenu</tt> is no longer
    needed.</p>

  <p>The other breakage is that the Starter Kit is now intended only
    for use with Emacs 24 onward. Yes, technically Emacs 24 has not
    yet been released, but it's in active pretest and is readily
    available for most platforms.[<a href="#fn1">1</a>]. I've been
    using it since 23 was released and have had no trouble with it.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>[<a name="fn1">1</a>] It's not hard to
    compile <a href="http://github.com/emacsmirror/emacs">from
    source</a>, but precompiled versions are readily available for
    <a href="http://emacs.naquadah.org/">Debian-based
    systems</a>, <a href="http://emacsformacosx.com/builds">Mac OS
    X</a>, and
    <a href="http://code.google.com/p/emacs-for-windows/updates/list">Windows</a>.</p>
