  <p>Well, it's finally out! I'm proud to announce that the Peepcode
    screencast I <a href='/119'>mentioned earlier</a> has been
    released and is
    <a href='https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/meet-emacs'>available for
    download</a>: an hour's worth of high-bandwidth
    knowledge transfer as only Mr. Grosenbach can deliver.</p>

  <p><b>Update</b>: PeepCode video courses are now distributed by PluralSight.</p>

  <p>You can see a list of topics it covers on the download page. It
    killed me how much I had to cut to make it fit in an hour!
    Fortunately the video comes with a document containing a full
    transcript including scenes that had to be cut, so you can still
    benefit from those parts.</p>

  <p>So
    far <a href='http://search.twitter.com/search?q=emacs+peepcode'>the
    response has been very positive</a>. It's great to have this out
    for folks to get started with. I also can't neglect to mention
    what a pleasure working with Peepcode has been; the whole
    authoring process is very streamlined, and the deal they offer is
    very generous.</p>

  <p>I hope you enjoy the video.</p>
