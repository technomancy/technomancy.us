        is my latest project:  a robot that I plan on building up and
        programming.</p>

  <p>I've got the motor hooked up and running,  "mocking out" the control
    logic to a pair of switches. The plan is to get my laptop on board
    and control the motors through the serial port. Apparently the
    circuitry for such a task involves using a UART chip to convert the
    serial signals into something usable,  which is going to be a bit of
    a challenge for me; I haven't worked with ICs before.</p>
  
  <p>Currently Norbert is capable of backward and forward motion as well
    as turning,  though the limitation of using switches on the chassis
    makes control somewhat impractical.</p>
  
  <p>The plan is all laid out in terms of what revisions will include
    what features: </p>
  
  <ol>
    <li>Simple motion (done)</li>
    <li>Turning capability through switches (done)</li>
    <li>Platform on which to mount laptop (done)</li>
    <li>Laptop controls forward motion</li>
    <li>Laptop controls turning</li>
    <li>Laptop controls forward/reverse</li>
    <li>Autonomy (laptop can be provided with a predetermined path to
      follow rather than requiring input each step of the way)</li>
    <li>Bump sensors so that it will stop rather than keep pushing into an
      unyielding object </li>
    <li>... and more brainstorming
    on <a href='http://dev.technomancy.us/phil/wiki/NorbertRobot'>the
    wiki page</a>.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>(<i>Italics</i> indicate completed revisions.)</p>

  <p>I drummed up a bit of code for the controller before I had really
    decided on parallel vs serial. (I had an old laptop I was
    considering using that had an easier-to-interface-with parallel
    port,  but it was lacking a battery.) Hopefully it shouldn't be too difficult
    to modify it to use the <a href='http://ruby-serialport.rubyforge.org'>
      ruby-serialport</a> library.</p>
