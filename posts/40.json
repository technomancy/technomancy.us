{"timestamp":"2006-03-20 14:22:10","title":"arorem","id":40,"content":"<p>I've just written a new Emacs mode for Rails development. I know there's already a <a href='https:\/\/opensvn.csie.org\/mvision\/emacs\/.emacs.d\/rails.el'> rails.el<\/a>, but it seemed like too much for me. For one thing, it assumes you're going to be using mmm-mode. In my experience, mmm-mode is a huge pain. If you make changes to a buffer, you have to manually re-parse the buffer to get the syntax highlighting to reflect your changes. It also assumes any ruby files you're editing are  going to use rails mode, which is absolutely unacceptable.<\/p>\n<p>So I scratched an itch: <a href='http:\/\/dev.technomancy.us\/phil\/wiki\/arorem'>arorem<\/a>  is Another Ruby on Rails Emacs Mode. It's much leaner than rails.el, skipping out on a lot of the stuff I don't use at all. (webrick management and documentation search, for instance.) It's got a dedicated rhtml major mode rather than trying to mix major modes on the fly via mmm-mode. Anyhow, more details are available <a href='http:\/\/dev.technomancy.us\/phil\/wiki\/arorem'>on my trac<\/a>. I'm very interested in seeing what other people think of this as it's my first nontrivial piece of elisp, so if you have anything to say please edit the wiki or <a href='http:\/\/dev.technomancy.us\/phil\/newticket'>file a ticket<\/a>.<\/p>"}
