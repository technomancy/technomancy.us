title: in which metaprogramming crosses several runtime boundaries

  <p>Since the <a href="/163">deprecation of swank-clojure</a> I've
  been a happy user of <a href="https://github.com/kingtim/nrepl.el">nrepl.el</a>
  for connecting to Clojure from Emacs. I had a lot easier time adding
  features than when doing so in swank-clojure.</p>

  <p>But the other day I was thinking about using
  the <a href="https://github.com/clojure/tools.trace">tools.trace</a>
  library, and realized it was a bit of a drag that you have to
  remember to load the code up front and then remember the exact
  invocation to enter in the repl to enable tracing on a given
  defn. It's not much, but if there's friction in between being in the
  zone and enabling a tool like that, you're likely to just fall back
  to printlns. I was looking through what it would take to toggle the
  tracing directly from Emacs, but at the time I wasn't really in the
  mood for writing a bunch of elisp, especially not if it had to be
  repeated for every command you'd want to add support for in
  nrepl.el. The worst part was that if the elisp needed to invoke any
  server-side code, it had to be embedded in the elisp code, usually
  as strings.</p>

  <p>This got me thinking about whether we could come up with a way to
  make commands self-describing in such a way that the editor (whether
  Emacs or another) could construct the appropriate commands
  automatically. I ended up putting together a
  <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/nrepl-discover">proof-of-concept</a>
  which annotated tools.trace such that it could be invoked directly
  from Emacs via <kbd>M-x nrepl-toggle-trace</kbd> or bound to a key
  combination by the user. When I found that posed little difficulty I
  went on to extend it to add a command to run tests from clojure.test
  as well in a way that could mostly deprecate
  <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/clojure-mode/blob/master/clojure-test-mode.el">clojure-test-mode</a>.</p>

  <p>The way it works is that on the server side vars are annotated
  with <tt>:nrepl/op</tt> metadata that describes the command's name,
  documentation, and arguments. Then an initial discovery endpoint is
  provided which can tell the client about all known ops. In my
  proof-of-concept, Emacs uses this data to construct
  elisp <tt>defun</tt>s which prompt the user for the arguments, often
  in ways involving fancy completion schemes. The results can be
  displayed either as a simple message or as a number of other richer
  formats. I've described the mechanism
  in <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/nrepl-discover/blob/master/Proposal.md">a
  slightly more formal proposal</a> here, which I hope could be useful
  to others wanting to annotate their own development tools or by
  maintainers of the Clojure tooling for Vim, Eclipse, etc.</p>

  <p>If you've got some piece of functionality you'd like to expose to
  users directly in their editor, please give it a shot. There's
  probably more discussion that needs to happen around the fancier
  response types as well as providing implementations for other
  clients. There's <a href="https://groups.google.com/group/clojure-tools/browse_thread/thread/c08b628a9af8346d">some
  discussion on the clojure-tools</a> mailing list where you can chime
  up with suggestions or notes on how it's worked for you.</p>
