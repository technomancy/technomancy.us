  <p>Just finished up RubyConf yesterday; it was most excellent. There
    were tons of quality talks,  and of course it's always fun to let
    yourself go and totally geek out. Last year I had Planet RubyConf
    set up,  but this year I got a late start and wasn't able to gather
    enough feeds to really do anything
    interesting. Luckily <a
    href="http://blog.nicksieger.com/articles/tag/rubyconf2006">Nick
    Sieger</a> was able to liveblog with astonishing prolificicity,  and
    the horde in #rubyconf
    was <a href="http://ni.hili.st/posts/pages/16">tumblelogging</a>
    like they were infected with a tumbleness disorder. Much fun and
    good-natured heckling was to be had. (Tip:  don't be That Guy.)</p>

    out-of-context quotes that attendees will have a jolly belly-laugh
    at and everyone else will scratch their heads reading: </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>Fact:  One time this programmer posted profiling data without
    noting his standard deviation,  and Zed Shaw vaporized him from
    across the room.</li>
    <li>"We tell the computer to do something and it does it. We tell
    people to do something,  and they don't. That's why we like computers
      better than people." - Forrest Chang</li>
    <li>Fact:  Zed Shaw's code profiles itself.</li>
    <li>"Take us to mongrel factor 9. But Sir,  Zed said that we do not
    need 9 mongrels!" - Adam Keyes</li>
    <li>Fact:  Zed Shaw is so awesome that he uses Chad Fowler as a
      remote control.</li>
    <li>"One of the more exciting things about Vista is its security is
      really good." - XAMLchick</li>
    <li>Fact:  Zed Shaw runs his production apps out of irb.</li>
    <li>"Myths:  YARV finds your girlfriend." - SASADA Koichi</li>
    <li>Fact:  Zed Shaw writes code using every single one of those
      250,000 [unicode] characters.</li>
    <li>"Hello Joe." "Hello Mike."</li>
    <li>Fact:  Zed Shaw rfuzzed your girlfriend.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>(The next time Zed is looking for a job his interviewers are going
    to have a blast poking around on Google. I think it'll improve his
    chances though; most teams would be improved by adding someone who
    can refactor living organisms.)</p>
  
  <p>A good portion of my time was spent pondering and discussing how to
    improve Emacs support for Ruby and Rails. I've been hacking a lot of
    that in my spare time,  and I'm pretty confident saying rhtml support
    has been much improved for it. We've also been talking a lot about
    Smalltalk-style refactoring support,  which will be a titanic
    task. Fortunately it looks
    like <a href="http://soc.jayunit.net/">some folks</a> have put some
    work in to hacking that for Eclipse. (I know... I know! Hopefully it
    can be extracted and generalized.)</p>
  
  <p>I got to brush shoulders with all sorts of top-notch fellow hackers
    and even got a conversation in with the
    venerable <a href="http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/">Matz</a> and the
    controversial <a href="http://tbray.org/ongoing">Tim
    Bray</a>. Mostly we talked about those refactoring
    ideas,  and Tim mentioned that leveraging tests would be a good way
    to get typing data about your code provided you've got good
    coverage. There's tons to be done,  but I'm excited to see how this
    progresses.</p>
