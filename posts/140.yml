title: in which the lessons of ZZ Top are applied to the marketplace

  <p>I've been thinking a lot about ZZ Top recently. This isn't
    something I generally do as a rule, but it was prompted by
    re-reading <a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2007/10/im-bad-im-nationwide-job-security-vs.html">a
    blog post</a> by the inimitable Giles Bowkett ostensibly about the
    song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxHyHk3h2IU">I'm Bad;
    I'm Nationwide</a>. Go ahead and cue that up in the background
    while you read this post; it's vaguely relevant.</p>

  <p>"Bad" in this sense of course is the good kind of bad, like the
    Michael Jackson song. It seems to be mostly about attitude. Giles
    makes the point that generally being bad is not correlated with
    being nationwide.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide" is a ZZ Top song. Hopefully
    you can figure out what it's about, but just in case, the singer's
    point is that he is bad, and he is nationwide. [...]</p>

    <p>It's good to be bad. It's good to be nationwide. It's
    even better to be worldwide. How can we apply the lessons of ZZ
    Top in the workplace?</p>

    <p>Obviously if you walk into your boss' office, jump on
    his or her desk, pull down your pants, and perform toilet
    functions all over the place, that would be bad. But it would not
    be nationwide, and it would not encourage becoming nationwide. In
    fact, it would not really be bad, it would just be stupid. But
    this silly example highlights a deeper paradox: that which is bad
    is usually local, and that which is nationwide is usually
    good.</p></blockquote>

  <p>Giles goes on to talk about how the bad/nationwide balancing act
    applies to a career in software development, which is interesting,
    but I've been thinking about it in terms of projects instead. Take
    the familiar realm of editors. There are a few of them that are
    nationwide just by virtue of having survived and built up a
    following over the course of several decades. And they're also
    often bad when flame wars erupt over them, as is fairly
    common.</p>

  <p>So Emacs and vi have somehow achieved the intersection of bad and
    nationwide, which as Giles posits is tricky to pull off. Simply
    being bad doesn't work in the long-term, and while quiet
    competence sometimes does, it's worth noting that in many cases
    attention helps a project improve in concrete
    ways&mdash;especially projects whose users are developers. This
    is pretty key for things like languages, libraries, and build tools.</p>

  <p>The problem I'm faced with here is that being bad is also often
    correlated with being inflammatory. The easiest way to get attention in
    the software world is to pick a fight. You see this <i>all the
    time</i> on sites like Reddit; when people smell blood they
    upvote, which is why stuff like
    <a href="http://dosync.posterous.com/clojure-nodejs-and-why-messaging-can-be-lame">Aleph
    vs Node.js: the smackdown</a> makes it to the front page despite
    being a superficial comparison.</p>

  <p>The thing you have to remember about picking fights with another
    project or language just for the sake of it is that often the
    attention fallout is more evenly distributed than is
    intended. When someone goes out of their way to pick a fight, they
    <a href="http://www.jroller.com/obie/entry/top_10_reasons_why_java">usually
    aren't much good at hiding the fact that they've got an investment
    in one side</a>. Impartial readers can usually pick up on this
    pretty easily, and they're likely to spot holes in the argument
    or write it off it as a piece of cheerleading. In cases of
    particularly unfair partisanship, they may even begin to
    sympathize with the target under attack.</p>

  <p>The closest I've come to this sort of bad/nationwide
    is <a href="http://twitter.com/technomancy/status/10994115673">this
    post I made on Twitter a few months back</a>:</p>

  <blockquote><p>Q: What's the difference between Ant and Maven? A: The
      creator of Ant has apologized.</p></blockquote>

  <p>This turned out to be just the right mix of nasty and clever
    to really take off; hundreds and hundreds of people passed it on, and
    over the next few days searches for my name came up with just
    pages and pages of this over and over again. At the time of this
    writing it's still on the second page of results in a search for
    my name.</p>

  <p>I've got to admit, as the author
    of <a href="http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen">a build
    system that competes with Maven</a>, this felt kind of good. The
    problem is it's totally a cheap shot&mdash;everyone involved with
    build tools ends up in a position of needing to apologize to their
    users given enough time. James Duncan Davidson has expressed his
    regrets over the use of XML in ant, Dave Thomas is less than proud
    of how RDoc has turned out, and I'm pretty sure the only reason
    the guy responsible for the tabs/spaces distinction in Makefiles
    hasn't apologized is that he fled to Tijuana for facial
    reconstructive surgery. Anyway, Leiningen will eventually be in
    the same position if it's not already.</p>

  <p>So we're still left with this question of whether you can be bad
    and nationwide without also being a jerk. I think it's doable, but
    you just don't see it much because picking fights is so much
    easier. One example that comes readily to mind
    is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_the_lucky_stiff">_why
    the lucky stiff</a>. He qualified not just by his off-kilter visual style
    but by his aversion to what he scoffed at as "best practices".</p>

  <blockquote><p>Perhaps this is why I have trouble swallowing unit
    testing or extreme programming or other best practices as the
    law. I guess there’s a place for these tricks (the work place,)
    but they do not speak to the pure form of hacking for hacking’s
    sake, which I so ardently defend! Unit testing, in particular, is
    designed to reel in spontaneous hacking. It is like framing a
    picture before it has been painted. Hacking, at heart, will
    continue to be something of spontaneous order, something of
    anarchy, and the landscape of hacking is something which comes
      from human action but is not of human design.</p>

  <p><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080512050317/hackety.org/2007/12/24/thisHackWasNotProperlyPlanned.html">&#8213;
      This Hack was not Properly Planned</a></p></blockquote>

  <p>This may not sound particularly controversial, but in the context
    of the test-driven-fanatic Ruby community it was a pretty weighty
    heresy. But he was all about exploring the fringe, and some
    excellent ideas came of it. It caught peoples' eyes and drew them
    in, so much so that when he disappeared, the communities
    surrounding his projects picked up the orphaned bits and carried
    them forward.</p>

  <p>Bad... and <i>nationwide</i>.</p>

  <p>This is way more productive than us-vs-them fights that normally
    accompany attempts to be bad and nationwide. So what does this
    mean for you and me? Most people can't draw like _why, but
    injecting your own particular brand of crazy into your projects
    may be a slick hack you can pull to sidestep the negativity.</p>

  <p>Here's an example: the <tt>new</tt> task in Leiningen spits out a
    blank Clojure project skeleton. At the time I saw a few too many
    "foojure"-type names popping up for new projects, and when I saw
    one called "Couverjure" I said enough is enough. Now
    the <tt>new</tt> task will refuse to generate projects named after
    *jure puns. Arbitrary? You bet. Ridiculous? Perhaps. But harmless
    and easy to work around. And don't forget controversial:</p>

  <a href="http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/commit/39732d5b649dedb70b14e88fe561dfc9ddb31611"><img src="/i/enough.png" alt="no more jure names" /></a>

  <p>The point is: don't take yourself too seriously. Hack the good
    hack and leave an easter egg or two around for the
    adventurous. Then you too can be bad... and <i>nationwide</i>.</p>
