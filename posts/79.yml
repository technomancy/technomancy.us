  <p>Somehow I'm getting a wifi signal in LAX,  so I'll be able to remedy
    the fact that I wasn't able to get a post in before I took off. As I
    <a href='http://philisha.net/2007/03/big-news/'>mentioned on my
    other blog</a>,  A and I are heading off to Indonesia for a
    month. I'll be doing training and setup with GNU/Linux,  Ruby,  and
    other Free Software at a small software development shop in Central Java.</p>
  
  <p>Before I left I had a bit more Javascript fun. My brother-in-law
    <a href='http://www.birdsofyore.com'>Loren Broach</a> came up with a
    game that I coded up. You
    can <a href='http://technomancy.us/code/monolith/index.html'>play it
    in your browser</a> if you want. I haven't done game programming in
    a while; that was a lot of fun. I haven't done GUI programming in a
    while; that aspect was only fun because it was so simple. The cool
    thing about it is that first I wrote it the way I normally write
    Javascript,  which is fairly procedural (and accordingly,  somewhat
    brain-dead). I got it working,  but then I rewrote it using
    Javascript's object-oriented prototype system. It was a fairly
    interesting exercise. I don't think anyone would defend procedural
    JS as a good way to write nontrivial software,  but I've only used it
    for fairly easy stuff in the past barring my few patches to
    Conkeror. This project really opened my eyes to see how you can use
    Javascript in a way that can scale in terms of readability and
    maintainability beyond the couple-page uses that I've had for it so
    far. I'm still on the fence as to whether I prefer Javascript's
    style of OO to the more conventional model. It really feels like
    you're just tossing around eigenclasses the whole time,  which takes
    some getting used to. It also resembles the OO system that Paul
    Graham implements in one of the appendices of his <i>ANSI Common
    Lisp</i> book. Anyway,  it's always fun to play with a new way of
    thinking.</p>
  
  <p>We <a href='http://philisha.net/2007/04/staging/'>cleared out our
    apartment</a> before we left,  so my server had to be moved to
    A's parents' house. A 311-day uptime isn't too unusual these
    days (especially with a UPS),  but I was disappointed to start from
    scratch again. Unfortunately A's parents' ISP is pulling some
    dirty moves and blocking all the interesting ports,  so I've had to
    move everything I can over to my account
    on <a href='http://dreamhost.com'>Dreamhost</a> in the mean time. I
    haven't been able to get Trac moved over; according to the Dreamhost
    wiki it's a fairly complex task. That means
    the <a href='http://dev.technomancy.us: 8080/conkeror'>Conkeror
    Trac</a> is only available on port 8080... sorry guys! I'll try to
    remedy that when I get the chance.</p>
