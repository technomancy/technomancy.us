  <p>When working on a project, I try to take care
    that <a href="http://www.jbarnette.com/2009/09/07/boring-things-first.html">a
    dev environment can be brought up with as little fuss as
    possible</a>. This requires some discipline even with simple
    programs, but once you get into the realm of <i>systems</i>, more
    up-front effort is required for repeatability.</p>

  <p>We've all been in the position of being the new hire on the
    team. On some teams you're lucky if you can get to actually
    running code on your machine in your first week. You think to
    yourself that it could surely be simplified, but once you're all
    set up there's not a lot of incentive to come back and make it
    easy for the next time.</p>

  <p>It's easy enough to track language-level
    dependencies using
    <a href="http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen">Leiningen</a>,
    Rubygems, or whatever is standard for your language, but very few
    large systems end there. You almost always have further external
    dependencies that are best handled by the system-level package
    manager, be they databases, message queues, or even your language
    runtime itself.</p>

  <p>I've found the best way to make sure this stuff is kept up is to
    make it the status quo. At work nearly everyone develops in a VM,
    and when a new dependency is needed, instead of everyone having to
    hunt down and install it, it just gets added to the setup
    script. This reduces redundancy as well as helping to
    eliminate <a href="http://codinghorror.typepad.com/.a/6a0120a85dcdae970b0128776ff992970c-pi">Works
    on My Machine</a> issues.</p>

  <p>Recently I've found <a href="http://vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> to
    be a really helpful tool for streamlining this process even
    further. Before I was using
    raw <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a>, which was
    all right for launching fresh VMs, though the interface was always
    a little awkward. Vagrant streamlines this greatly, making it
    trivial to configure, suspend, and rebuild VMs. It also helps keep
    the configuration of the VM alongside the project for which it's
    meant.</p>

  <p>Vagrant allows you to provision new VMs
    with <a href="http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/">Chef</a>. While
    this is pretty handy if you've already got recipes written, it's a
    bit intimidating as the mental model needed to operate Chef is
    quite baroque. But it's easy enough to bypass Chef and
    provide <a href="https://github.com/Seajure/emacs-clojure-vagrant/blob/master/clojure_emacs.sh">an
    arbitrary shell script</a> as a provisioner. You need to take a
    bit of care to ensure the script is idempotent as it's much more
    useful if you can re-run it whenever the dependencies change, but
    it's a great way to get started.</p>

  <p>There are a few gotchas. Vagrant is rather particular about what
    version of Virtualbox (and the VBox extension pack) you use, and
    reinstalling Virtualbox only makes it confused. The OSS edition
    isn't supported, but thankfully an apt repository is
    available:</p>

  <pre style="font-size: 80%;">$ sudo apt-add-repository "deb http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian $(lsb_release -cs) contrib"
  $ wget -q -O - http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/debian/oracle_vbox.asc | sudo apt-key add -
  $ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install virtualbox-4.0
  $ sudo gem install vagrant</pre>

  <p>On a related note, I've had had a couple people ask what a good
    project to get started with Clojure web programming would be. The
    most widely-used Clojure web app that I know of
    is <a href="http://clojars.org">Clojars</a>, the community
    repository. But it's been pretty dormant recently; there are
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojars-maintainers/browse_thread/thread/d4149ec96316d5b1">plenty
    of great features</a> just waiting to be implemented, but getting
    it set up is hard work given all the moving parts.</p>

  <p>Vagrant is perfect for smoothing this over. I've got
    a <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/clojars-web/tree/vagrant">vagrant
    branch of clojars</a> that makes it as simple as <kbd>vagrant
    up</kbd> (modulo a small issue with the nailgun scp server I'm
    still working out). So this should allow folks to contribute to
    the codebase more easily.</p>

  <p>I've also helped out
    with <a href="https://github.com/Seajure/emacs-clojure-vagrant">Justin
    Lilly's Clojure/Emacs environment</a> which provides a
    fully-configured Emacs 24 install intended to help facilitate our
    <a href="http://seajure.github.com">Seajure hackfests</a>. Give
    it a try if you've had trouble configuring Emacs for Clojure
    hacking. And feel free to crib from these setups for automating
    your own projects.</p>
