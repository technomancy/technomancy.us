<p>Funny story:  when I was in eighth grade,  I was a crack QBasic
programmer. I was about as good as you can get at writing QBasic code, 
which says a lot about QBasic and not much about my own skill
level. I'd written a few games,  and I decided I wanted to make
something that would allow others to make text adventure games. My
program would ask questions and output the text adventure as runnable
QBasic code. Thus began my first foray into metaprogramming and
perhaps the most foolish coding project I would ever attempt. (Though
my program could output games just fine,  it had a difficult time
loading them back in and editing them.)</p>

<p>Speaking of metaprogramming,  I had a stimulating conversation with
a philosopher yesterday about <a
href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_logic'>symbolic logic</a>
that turned towards Lisp and AI. Symbolic logic attempts to describe
knowledge by use of a specific dialect. (I'm sure I'm oversimplifying, 
but this seems to be the aspect which most relates to what I
understand.)  My discovery of the night was that Lisp is particularly
suited to AI because it's very good at metaprogramming because
metaprogramming is almost the same thing as learning. (I sense this
statement needs to be backed up,  but I'm not sure how.) The problem
with writing AI is that it goes beyond metaprogramming--an AI system
must metaprogram itself,  and thus writing an AI system would be
meta-meta-programming.</p>", "tags": "lisp, projects"}
