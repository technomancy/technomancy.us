  <p>Back when Leiningen was <a href="/131">first launched</a> it
    coincided with the launch
    of <a href="http://clojars.org">Clojars</a>, the public community
    repository for Clojure
    projects. This <a href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/11/clojars-leiningen-clojure">worked
    out really well</a> for Clojure as far as the timing was
    concerned&mdash;it allowed the ecosystem to grow quickly.</p>

  <img src="/i/chain-stump.jpg" alt="scenery" align="right" />

  <p>But
    Clojars <a href="http://mobile.twitter.com/cemerick/status/45923604000555008">doesn't
    work for everything</a>; some situations call for libraries to be
    shared on a team without making them public. For cases like this
    it's necessary to publish to private repositories. This has been a
    really common question with Leiningen that hasn't had a good
    answer until recently; some folks bite the bullet and run <tt>lein
    install</tt> on every development machine while others set up
    shared static-file repositories maintained mostly by
    hand. At <a href="http://sonian.net">work</a> we've nginx'd up a
    directory that gets deployed to from our Hudson (soon to
    be <a href="http://jenkinsci.org">Jenkins</a>) jobs.</p>

  <p>But the 1.5.0 release of Leiningen has added the <tt>deploy</tt>
    task along with
    a <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/stable/DEPLOY.md">deploy
    guide</a>. Now you can deploy to private repositories like
    instances of <a href="http://archiva.apache.org">Archiva</a> and
    <a href="http://nexus.sonatype.org">Nexus</a>. Just configure
    your <tt>:repositories</tt> in project.clj with the URL and
    credentials for uploading:</p>

  <pre class="code" style="font-size: 90%;">
    <span class="builtin">:repositories</span> {<span class="string">"snapshots"</span> {<span class="builtin">:url</span> <span class="string">"http://blueant.com/archiva/snapshots"</span>
                                <span class="builtin">:username</span> <span class="string">"milgrim"</span> <span class="builtin">:password</span> <span class="string">"locative.1"</span>}
                   <span class="string">"releases"</span> <span class="string">"http://blueant.com/archiva/internal"</span>}</pre>

  <p>If you're shy about checking passwords into project.clj, you can
    put them in <tt>~/.lein/init.clj</tt> as mentioned in
    the <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/stable/DEPLOY.md">deploy
    guide</a>. Note that the naming is significant; if you are
    deploying a <code>SNAPSHOT</code> version, it will go to the
    "snapshots" repository, while stable versions will go to the
    "releases" repository. Hopefully this is useful for teams
    collaborating on multiple projects in private.</p>

  <p><b>Update</b>: Don't store your repository credentials in
    plaintext on your drive. Leiningen 2 features transparent GPG
    support if you store them in <tt>~/.lein/credentials.clj.gpg</tt>,
    which you should use instead.</p>
