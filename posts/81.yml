    is a go. The first day is just wrapping up,  and I've finally got
    some downtime. First impressions:  Portland is a great place for a
    conference. There's green everywhere,  and being within the free ride
    zone for the transit system is quite handy. Having
    <a href='http://www.powells.com/technicalbooks'>Powell's Technical
    Books</a> around is an &uuml;bergeek joy. To top it off,  there's
    municipal wireless that would be easily up for the task of handling
    a tech crowd of the size of any previous Ruby-related
    conference. Unfortunately,  we've got more than twice as many
    attendees here than any previous conference,  so that part of the
    equation isn't holding up quite so well.</p>
  
  <p>Speaking of... the crowd. It really is quite a sight. If you
    thought last year's RailsConf was big,  that seems like a warm-up in
    comparison. I've heard estimates from 1200 to 1600&mdash;It's
    staggering. In some sense,  it's a coming-of-age for Rails; this is
    approaching OSCON in size. But it's also a reminder that the heady
    days of <a href='/8'>RubyConf 05</a> are long gone. It's an
    unavoidable side-effect of success,  but losing the tightly-knit
    erudite community that so felt cutting-edge and pioneering is a
    shame. But it's probably worth it as the price of having more
    people share in the fun.</p>

  <p>Tonight's keynotes were
    from <a href='http://smallthought.com/avi/'>Avi Bryant</a>
    and <a href='http://zefrank.com'>Ze Frank</a>. Ze had an immensely
    fun talk about how audiences contribute and how the Web is
    accelerating that kind of thing. He's funny as the dickens,  but it
    turns out he's got a sharp technical mind. Avi's talk was probably
    the most thought-provoking thing I've heard in a while. He talked
    about how there's no reason Ruby can't be
    totally <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-hosting'>self-hosting</a>.
    Having core classes like Array and Hash implemented in C is
    currently necessary from a performance point of view,  but it causes
    annoyances when you want to peek behind the curtain.</p>
  
  <p>Avi agreed that for Rails web applications,  performance is usually
    not directly very important&mdash;if you've got enough users to feel
    performance pains,  you're likely to have enough money to deal with
    it. (If you don't,  I imagine the problems with your revenue plan are
    likely to be more pressing than your technical problems.) The thing
    is,  performance <i>indirectly</i> affects your app in a huge way:  it
    limits
    the <a href='http://blog.caboo.se/articles/2007/4/8/heresy-and-turtles-all-the-way-down-with-avi-bryant'>Turtle
    Factor</a>.</p>
  <img src='/i/turtles1.png' alt='low turtle factor' align='left' />
         
  <p>"Turtles all the way down" refers to how much of the language is
    accessible from within the language itself. We're talking about
    reflection,  metaprogramming,  and being able to redefine things on
    the fly&mdash;all the hallmarks of dynamicity.</p>
  
  <p>The current Ruby implementation (MRI) is good for a Unixy language, 
    but it could be better. But when you run into stuff written in C, 
    (altering the behaviour of Arrays,  for instance) the Turtle Factor
    hits a bit of trouble: </p>
  
  <img src='/i/shredder.gif' alt='shredder' align='right' />
  
  <p>Ideally,  Ruby would give programs access (in Ruby) to every level
    of the language,  which would be much easier to do (according to Avi)
    on a Smalltalk VM. One problem I ran into that this would solve is
    that you can't specify how identity should be calculated when
    storing things in a Hash. Occasionally I've found myself wanting to
    override the default behaviour for certain objects that should be
    treated differently,  which is easy in (say) Lisp.</p>

  <p>It sounds like the low turtle factor of MRI Ruby is necessary in
    order to achieve decent performance in the current implementation, 
    but apparently investment in a Smalltalk VM would leave turtle
    factor much improved. Ruby could join the likes of the classic
    self-hosting dynamic languages that have had decades to work on this
    kind of thing. The exciting thing is that Rubinius is already
    working in this direction; taking cues from the design of Smalltalk
    if not porting to it outright. Can't wait to see where all this heads.</p>

  <p>On an unrelated note,  I've just ported my blog over to a new
    platform. I'll be posting more on that later,  but in the mean time
    please excuse the mess; many key features (tags,  feeds,  comment
    formatting) haven't been implemented yet.</p>
