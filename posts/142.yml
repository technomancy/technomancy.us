  <p>I got back last night from a week in <abbr title="Boston-Atlanta
    Metropolitan Axis">BAMA</abbr> for
    the <a href="http://first.clojure-conj.org/">Clojure Conj</a>
    conference. The consistent quality of the talks surpassed any
    other conference I've attended so far, and there was a palpable
    high-energy air of potential with so many focused hackers
    congregating for the first time. The only downside was that the
    breakneck pace of fitting all the talks into two days left little
    time for ad-hoc chatter and hackfests, something I've greatly
    enjoyed at Ruby conferences.</p>

  <p>I got a chance to speak on
    Leiningen. [<a href="http://p.hagelb.org/conj-2010-slides.org.html">slides</a>]
    I opened with basic usage followed by a few little-known but
    useful features. After that I took some time to explain how
    Leiningen tasks are written and <a href="/141">extended</a>. I
    spent a little more time on this since
    it's <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3906276/whats-the-difference-between-cake-and-leiningen/3908108#3908108">something
    that folks have asked about recently</a>. The gist I tried to get
    across is that it's best to structure core concepts like tasks
    around functions rather than one-off mechanisms like macros or
    custom deftypes if at all possible as it encourages composability
    and is instantly recognizable to users at a glance.</p>

  <p>It turned out the emphasis on functions in order to support
    composability was a common theme that everyone seemed to come back
    around to, most notably Mark McGranahan on Ring and Stuart
    Halloway on simplicity in general.</p>

  <p>Near the end of the conference Rich gave a self-professed
    non-technical rant on the simple subject of thinking hard about
    hard problems. He said that one of the things he's most thankful
    of in his life is the opportunity to spend years thinking about a
    few problems. The idea that you could think about a hard problem
    for months on end, in what he termed "hammock time", is something
    most people (myself included) just hadn't ever considered.</p>

  <p>When I met him after the <a href="/139">Emerging Languages</a>
    conference earlier this year, he mentioned how the notion of
    linear version numbers no longer meshes with the reality of
    distributed development. On
    <a href="http://clojars.org">Clojars</a> there's a notion of
    non-canonical versions being distributed under a separate group,
    which makes Maven unable to weed out duplicates. But if they were
    kept under the same group, it would have to use version numbers to
    distinguish between the official version and the patched
    one-offs. Even in a non-forked project you have branches from
    which you may wish to publish artifacts. Being linear, version
    numbers are really not well-suited for this. They are
    lexographically sorted, which means there's no way to denote that
    <code>1.3.0-alpha3</code> may be newer
    than <code>1.3.0-par2</code>. Dependency management needs to
    accept the fact that versions branch into trees. But representing
    it as such is really only the first step; the other tricky part is
    coming up with a strategy to choose a branch and how to decide
    between different dependencies that both may request different
    branches of a third dependency. It's a juicy problem that was also
    mentioned a few times at the Conj, and it may be the kind of
    "hammock time" problem to keep in the back of my mind for a few
    months or years.</p>
