Men on a lower level of understanding,  when brought into contact with phenomena of a higher order,  instead of making efforts to understand them,  to raise themselves up to the point of view from which they must look at the subject,  judge it from their lower standpoint,  and the less they understand what they are talking about,  the more confidently and unhesitatingly they pass judgment on it.<\/blockquote> <p>--Leo Tolstoy explains why people don't like Lisp<\/p>\n<blockquote>Here is Edward Bear (a.k.a. Winnie The Pooh),  coming down the stairs,  bump,  bump,  bump,  on the back of his head,  behind Christopher Robin. It is,  as far as he knows,  the only way of coming downstairs,  but sometimes he feels that there really is another way,  if only he could stop bumping for a moment and think of it. And then he feels that perhaps there isn't.<\/blockquote> <p>--A. A. Milne explaining statically-typed languages<\/p>\n<blockquote>Well,  you'll be using Guiness in your stew,  sure.  Makes it rich and creamy.  But for just drinking,  you probably want to go with Budwieser.  It's easier to drink because it's watery and thin and lacks any flavour.  Oh,  and everybody else drinks it,  so it MUST be a good beer... and since you are just starting out drinking beer,  you should start with the worst possible solution.<\/blockquote> <p>--on C++ and similar languages.<\/p>\n<blockquote>Giving the Linus Torvalds Award to the Free Software Foundation is a bit like giving the Han Solo Award to the Rebel Alliance.<\/blockquote> <p>--Richard Stallman<\/p>"}
