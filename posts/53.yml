  <p>Well,  it looks like I spoke too soon about not having anything
    interesting going on.</p>
  
  <blockquote> The <a
  href="http://dev.technomancy.us/phil/wiki/ExceptionIM">Exception IM
  Notifier plugin</a> is just like the regular Exception Notifier by
  Jamis Buck except that it uses <a
  href="http://trypticon.org/software/actionmessenger/">ActionMessenger</a>
  to send instant messages rather than using ActionMailer to send
  email.</blockquote>
  
  <p>Just do your usual <tt>script/plugin install -x
      svn://technomancy.us/exception-im</tt> and follow the directions
      there.</p>
  
  <p>Note that you'll only get notification in production mode for
    obvious reasons. If you'd like to try it in development just to
    confirm that it's working,  replace "rescue_action_in_public" on line
    70 of exception_notifiable.rb with "rescue_action".</p>
  
  <p>Anyway,  give it a go. Plans for future improvement include AIM
    integration (so far it's just Jabber) and the ability to fall back
    on email notification if the user is not online.</p>
  
  <p>Oh,  also I found out that <a
  href="http://dev.technomancy.us/phil/wiki/ebby">Ebby</a> got mentioned
  in <a
  href="http://applications.linux.com/article.pl?sid=06/06/27/1837234&tid=47&tid=13&tid=100">a
  Linux.com article</a>. It was a pretty insignificant blurb,  but it
  still seems cool by my low standards. (I've never had any high-profile
  mention but for a quick link on RedHanded.)</p>
