  <p>Has it really almost been a week? Well,  it's been a good week for
    hacks.</p>
  
  <p><a href='http://dev.technomancy.us/phil/wiki/ElUnit'>ElUnit</a> is
    a unit testing framework for Emacs Lisp designed to allow
    Test-Driven development. I believe it to be pretty much at release
    quality,  though a few more convenience macros (assert-equal,  for
    instance) remain to be written. You define suites of tests using
    the <code>defsuite</code> macro: </p>
  
      <pre class='code'>
  (defsuite <span class="keyword">my-test-suite</span>
    (two-plus-two
      <span class="string">"Test that 2 + 2 = 4"</span>
      (<span class="warning">assert</span> (equal 4 (+ 2 2))))
  
    (another-test
      (<span class="warning">assert</span> (equal 0 (- 2 2))))
  
    (bad-math
      <span class="string">"This test should fail!"</span>
      (<span class="warning">assert</span> (equal 5 (+ 2 2))))
  
    (another-test
      <span class="string">"duplicate should overwrite original"</span>
      (<span class="warning">assert</span> (equal 3 (length (elunit-suite 'my-test-suite))))))
  
  (add-hook 'my-test-suite-teardown-hook (<span class="keyword">lambda</span> () (message <span class="string">"teardown hook"</span>)))
  </pre>
  
  <p><kbd>M-x elunit</kbd> gets you some nicely formatted reports: </p>
  
  <pre class='code'>
  Loaded suite:  my-test-suite
  
  .<span style='color:  red;'>F</span>.
  
  1) Failure:  bad-math [<u>/home/phil/.emacs.d/elunit-test.el: 13</u>]
              This test should fail!
      Result:  (cl-assertion-failed (equal 5 (+ 2 2)))
  
  
  3 tests total,  1 failures in 0 seconds.
  </pre>
  
  <p>How many times do I have to tell you that two plus two is four?
    Anyway,  I'm pretty happy with the results,  especially considering I
    was able to keep it at about 90 LOC. Give it a shot,  and if you've
    got anything to say,  pipe up
    on <a href='http://dev.technomancy.us/phil/wiki/ElUnit'>the wiki
    discussion</a>.</p>
