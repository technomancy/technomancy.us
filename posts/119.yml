  <p>I've recently been trying to take advantage of
    the <a href='/115'>recent upswing in interest in Emacs</a> by
    working on things to help folks get started easily. I'm proud to
    announce that I'm working with the illustrious Geoffrey Grosenbach
    on a Peepcode screencast about learning Emacs and Lisp. Peepcode
    is well-known especially in the Ruby community for producing
    high-quality, hour-long, informative commercial screencasts. I'm
    doing the writing and coding for it, and Geoff will bring his
    trademark charm with voiceovers and slick recording.</p>

  <p>Geoff makes it look easy, but creating a professional screencast
    is actually tons of work. I'm nearly half-way through writing the
    outline, but the outline is only the beginning. I know a lot of
    people are looking forward to this, so I'm eager to get something
    out there soon.</p>

  <p>While you're waiting on me, you can take a look at my new
    project called
    the <a href='http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/'>Emacs
    Starter Kit</a>. It's designed to be a companion to the
    Peepcode&mdash;a set of dotfiles extracted from
    my <a href='http://github.com/technomancy/dotfiles/commits/master/.emacs.d'>years
    of obsessive Emacs tweaking</a>. It acts as a base config from
    which new users can get going with minimal fuss. You
    won't <i>learn</i> Emacs from it, but it will help you get started
    out as it provides saner defaults and bundles a lot of really
    useful functionality.</p>

  <p>I've been using it as my main config for quite some time now, so
    it's got all the libraries I need. If you're interested in trying
    out with Emacs but don't know where to start, give this a shot. If
    you're an old hand but are curious to pick up some new tricks, try
    out the starter kit and let me know if it's missing some must-have
    functionality that you're used to.</p>

  <p><b>Update</b>:
    Geoff <a href='http://nubyonrails.com/articles/emacs-emacs'>posted
    a short screencast</a> on getting around Emacs and his first
    impressions. It should serve as a nice teaser.</p>

  <p><b>Update</b>: Please don't use the Emacs Starter Kit; the
    approach of bundling together unrelated functionality has a number
    of inherent problems, and it's much better addressed by small,
    focused packages. Check out <a

    for a better solution.</p>
