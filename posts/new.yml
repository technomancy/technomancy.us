  	   <p>So I was reading <a href='http://planet.lisp.org'>Planet
	   Lisp</a> the other day, and I came across <a
	   href='http://lemonodor.com/archives/001382.html'>Lemonodor's
	   post on Startup School</a>. In it he mentions how attendees
	   were able to keep notes via <a
	   href='http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/'>SubEthaEdit</a>.
	   </p>
	   
	   <p>Now, I had a rather mixed response to this. The
	   pragmatist in me thought, "Oh, cool; they were able to take
	   more comprehensive notes on the event with this neat piece
	   of collaborative software." The idealist in me thought,
	   "Wait, this is bad; it increases reliance on software that
	   is not only closed, but is developed by people who <a
	   href='http://crschmidt.livejournal.com/259345.html'>totally
	   disregard</a> users' freedom to interoperate." Finally, the
	   pragmatist in me came around, "Oh crap, if <b>I</b> were
	   there, I wouldn't have been able to take part in this. No good!"</p>
	   
	   <p>So, with the help of the excellent <a
	   href='http://darcs.0x539.de/trac/obby/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/ObbyProtocol'>Obby
	   protocol</a>, the dynamic power of Emacs Lisp, and some
	   spare hacking time in the past three days, I've come up
	   with <a
	   href='http://dev.technomancy.us/phil/wiki/ebby'>Ebby</a>, a
	   library that allows Emacs to collaboratively edit documents
	   in a synchronized way. It doesn't have a shiny icon, but I
	   hope you give it a shot.</p>
	   
	   <p>Note that Ebby only runs as a client; you'll have to get
	   <a href='http://darcs.0x539.de/'>Gobby</a> to run as a
	   server to connect to. Ebby connects to Gobby version 0.3,
	   which seems to be the latest stable version at the time of
	   this writing. If you can't install Gobby, (or just don't
	   feel like it) you can try connecting to my server at
	   technomancy.us, but there's no guarantee that it will be
	   running at all times.</p>
	   
	   <p>So please try it out and add your comments to
	   <a href='http://dev.technomancy.us/phil/wiki/ebby'>the
	   wiki</a>. Don't be shy about <a
