  <p>When I <a href="/121">first got started with Clojure</a> I was
    disappointed that the process of getting started was pretty rough
    around the edges, but one of the things that helped sustain my
    momentum was the fact that I could
    use <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">SLIME</a> to
    write Clojure code from Emacs via
    the <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure">swank-clojure</a>
    project, running and testing it while in the middle of writing it.
    This helped me overlook the fact that I needed to construct
    nasty <tt>java</tt> command-line invocations to launch the
    process.</p>

  <p>As time went on I did what I could to try to improve the
    situation. <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/clojure-mode/blob/47caba15ff31f339e74378fd3c05bcffa7091550/clojure-mode.el#L627">Early</a> <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit/blob/63797f61aa7019e2cc5f0e79793f8bdd4b50ad21/starter-kit-lisp.el#L39">attempts</a>
    were quite primitive, but eventually
    when <a href="http://leiningen.org">Leiningen</a> came out
    the <tt>lein swank</tt> command obsoleted all my hokey elisp
    setup scripting. Still a few other things kept it from being a
    really smooth experience. The main issue is that SLIME was
    developed primarily for Common Lisp. The protocol behind it
    changes every so often, and there aren't any stable releases;
    users are expected to simply run straight out of CVS.</p>

  <p>When the creator of swank-clojure passed maintainership to me, I
    kept things going by applying patches and adding a handful of
    features at the edges, but nobody really understood the ins and
    outs of the project. Part of this was because it was just a really
    old quirky codebase, (most of it predated the introduction of
    Clojure atoms) but part of it was because it was a fairly literal
    port of the Common Lisp server.</p>

  <p>The end result was that SLIME moved forward while swank-clojure
    stood still. This mostly worked once we bundled a frozen SLIME
    revision, but it was common to have confused users wander into the
    IRC channel with a broken setup, unsure of where it went wrong or
    how to get the right SLIME. Even for experienced users it was
    impossible to have a setup that could connect to both Clojure and
    Common Lisp at the same time.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile in Clojure-land
    the <a href="https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl">nREPL</a>
    project was started as a tool-agnostic counterpart to
    swank-clojure, building a general networked repl server and an
    ecosystem around it. While I appreciated the idea, I thought that
    it would be a long time before Emacs support for it could catch up
    to the level of functionality in SLIME.</p>

  <p>Still, one evening on a short flight to San Francisco I bashed
    out the beginnings of an nREPL client in Emacs. I got a bit stuck
    on the socket-based bencode functionality and dropped it after the
    flight, but not before pushing the code out and
    <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/2bd91de7dca55ca4">mentioning
      it on the Clojure mailing list</a>.</p>

  <p>Fortunately Tim
    King <a href="https://github.com/kingtim/nrepl.el/">picked it back
    up</a>, and now it has quickly become a respectable competitor to
    SLIME. I've switched over to it for day-to-day use. The main thing
    I've noticed about it is how accessible the codebase is; I've
    found it very easy to dive in and add features. So even though
    it's still missing a few things that SLIME boasts, it's on course
    to improve at a steady pace. It also works out of the box with
    Leiningen 2.x's <tt>repl</tt> task without any extra plugin
    needed.</p>

  <p>It's now gotten to the point where I'm ready to consider
    swank-clojure deprecated. Of course, it will go on working, so if
    you already have a setup that works for you, there's no need to
    switch. Also if you find yourself particularly attached to the
    inspector or debugger from SLIME you might want to hold off. (For
    debugging in particular
    the <a href="https://github.com/pallet/ritz">ritz</a> project
    works with SLIME and has advanced debugging features.) But if
    you're looking for a simpler way to get
    started, <a href="https://github.com/kingtim/nrepl.el">give
    nrepl.el a try</a>.</p>

  <p><b>Update</b>: Jeffrey Chu, original author of swank-clojure,
    writes: <i>As creator of swank-clojure, I'm a little sad to see it
    die. But I'm very happy to see that it's being replaced by
    something designed/maintainable instead of hacked about just to
    scratch an itch. Thanks for keeping it alive all this time and I
    look forward to the great work coming out of nrepl.el.</i></p>
