  <p>So I've been working on modularizing a big project at work. The REST API for this one project needs to be used in multiple places, so
  I've taken it out of the Rails app and spun it off into its own server
  using <a href='http://rack.rubyforge.org'>Rack</a>. Rack is a library
  that abstracts away the gory details of HTTP and gives you a nice
  object-oriented wrapper for it, allowing you to plug it into multiple
  different backends. It's great for accelerating development on your
  simple lightweight services that wouldn't otherwise justify a Merb or
  Rails application. Ezra gives <a
  href='http://brainspl.at/articles/2008/02/16/so-merb-core-is-built-on-rack-you-say-why-should-i-care'>a
  good explanation of why you might be interested in Rack</a>.</p>
  
  <p>Anyhow, I was able to put this together fairly quickly by hooking
  up libxml, ActiveRecord, and Rack. (If I were doing it again I'd use
  <a
  href='http://github.com/codahale/faster-builder/tree/master'>faster-builder</a>,
  which I found out about a few hours after I started the project, but
  whatever.) But this particular project must be able to support
  ridiculously large XML responses that could be larger than 4GB. On a
  32-bit machine this is... well... problematic. The solution, of
  course, is to stream the response back to the client as it's
  generated so it doesn't have to all be in memory at once.</p>
  
  <p>Unfortunately the only Ruby support for HTTP streaming I was able
  to find by searching the web is about streaming static files. I was
  getting pretty discouraged until Ezra mentioned that Merb bundles a
  patched version of Rack that allows streaming of programmatic
  content.</p>
  
  <p>Sure enough, Merb's changes to Rack <a
  href='http://technomancy.us/static/code/streaming_quine.rb'>do the
  trick</a>:</p>
  
  <pre class='code'>require <span class='string'>'rubygems'</span>
  require <span class='string'>'rack/response'</span>
  require <span class='string'>'rack/handler/mongrel'</span>
  
  <span class='comment-delimiter'># </span><span class='comment'>Launches an HTTP server on http://localhost:9999/N that streams its own code N times
  </span><span class='type'>Rack</span>::<span class='type'>Handler</span>::<span class='type'>Mongrel</span>.run(<span class='type'>Proc</span>.new <span class='keyword'>do</span> |env|
                               [200, {}, <span class='type'>Proc</span>.new <span class='keyword'>do</span> |response|
                                  response.send_status_no_connection_close(<span class='string'>''</span>)
                                  response.send_header
                                  env[<span class='string'>'PATH_INFO'</span>][/(\d+)/].to_i.times <span class='keyword'>do</span>
                                    response.write <span class='type'>File</span>.read(__FILE__) + <span class='string'>'\n'</span>; sleep 1
                                  <span class='keyword'>end</span>
                                  response.write <span class='string'>'\r\n\r\n'</span>
                                <span class='keyword'>end</span>]
                             <span class='keyword'>end</span>, :<span class='type'>Port</span> =&gt; 9999)
  </pre>
  
  <p>I check the streaming with curl; if it's properly streamed the <tt>%
  Received</tt> will climb slowly instead of jumping at once to 100:</p>
  
  <pre class='code'>$ curl http://localhost:9999/7 > /dev/null
    % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                   Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  100  5310    0  5310    0     0    755      0 --:--:--  0:00:07 --:--:--   796</pre>
  
  <p>It's not clear to me why this functionality isn't in the standard
  Rack distribution. Merb seems to be Rack's biggest user, so the fact
  that they have to bundle their own patched version seemes quite
  odd. Anyway, if you need HTTP streaming outside Merb, you can use my
  <a href='http://technomancy.us/static/code/rack-0.3.0.gem'>version of
  Rack</a>. I haven't been able to get the gem served by Github;
  unreproducible remote problems in the gem build process are very
  opaque and give no feedback. Will look into this later.</p>
  
  <p>I'm going to try to get the changes into the mainline rack, but if
  Merb hasn't been able to get it accepted this may not actually
  happen. The meat of the patch is three lines, but I've got a bunch
  of other stuff that allows the project to actually build as a gem;
  the source as I found it was not in a working state. (Who knew there
  were people out there who haven't yet discovered <a
  href='http://http://blog.zenspider.com/2006/09/farmer-ted-uses-hoe-to-beat-ra.html'>hoe</a>?)</p>
  
  <p>Much thanks to Ezra for the fix. I was starting to lose hope that
  I'd even be able to even pull this off without resorting to
  low-level Mongrel invocations. Even though the fix is available in
  Merb, it's not really very clear how to use it, so I thought this
  post would save other people from going through the same crazy hoops
  I had to.</p>
