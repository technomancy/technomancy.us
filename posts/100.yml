  <p>I've <a href='http://philisha.net/2007/12/noah.html'>covered this in more detail on my personal blog</a>,  but my son was born last week on Christmas. His name is Noah Obadiah Augustine Hagelberg,  and he has <a href='http://noah.hagelb.org'>his own domain</a> for photos. He's doing fine,  but it's going to take a lot of adjusting to the new life of a parent. I'm looking forward to it.</p>
