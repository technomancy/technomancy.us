  <p>I've got a laptop and a desktop. I want to check mail on the
  desktop and have that act as the definitive copy. So when the desktop
  pulls in mail,  it deletes it off the server. I want to use the laptop
  to pull in mail,  but only when I'm not at my desktop. It keeps a
  non-authoritative copy that may have vast holes in its archives; no
  big deal.</p>
  
  <p>The problem is,  I don't want mail to get checked when I'm away from
  my desktop. I could just manually start and stop the fetchmail d&aelig;mon, 
  but that's tacky. This script uses xautolock to determine the idle
  time of X. If it's been active in the last three minutes,  it should
  pull in the mail; otherwise leave it alone. If it's on my laptop
  (vannevar) then keep mail on the server for my desktop to consume.</p>
  
  <p>As you can see,  I'm no shell wizard. Using hidden files is slightly
  tacky,  but it gets the job done.</p>
