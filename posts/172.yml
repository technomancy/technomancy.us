title: in which a collection of keys are gathered and put to good use

  <p>Choosing computer hardware is really all about trade-offs. For
    the kind of work I do these days once a machine has an SSD in it
    nearly anything will get me the performance I need. So I start to
    look towards creature comforts&mdash;the keyboard and screen are
    the gateways from the physical world into the machine, and for the
    amount of time I spend with them, it makes sense to get the best
    that money can buy. This rules out glossy screens and the
    low-resolution laptop displays that have become ubiquitous in
    recent years, so my options have been limited.</p>

  <p>Last year I <a href="/160">took a chance on a new laptop</a>:
    the Samsung Series 9 wooed me with its bright, relatively
    high-resolution matte screen, and I took a chance on it even knowing
    that its keyboard was a step backwards. This turned out to
    be a mistake for me&mdash;the trend of thinness over all else
    forced its designers into some unfortunate compromises around the
    keyboard. There just isn't enough room on an ultrabook for keys
    that have a comfortable travel, to speak nothing of the
    response. So I went back to my 2009-era Thinkpad with its adequate
    screen and decent keyboard, since newer Thinkpads sported brighter
    screens but significantly fewer pixels.</p>

  <p>It wasn't always this difficult to find nice
    keyboards. Relentless cost-cutting has pushed manufacturers
    towards keyboards built mostly out of rubber underneath the caps
    and forced quality key switches to a niche populated mostly by
    gamers and obsessive programmers like me. But if you're
    willing to do some digging, you can find some fantastic
    options. The standard bearer here for a long time has been the
    venerable <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard">IBM
    Model M</a> with its buckling spring mechanism. Though IBM hasn't
    sold them since the mid-90s, many extant keyboards from that time
    are still in daily use. They offer a solid, tactile response
    that evokes a passionate fondness in their users.</p>

  <p>I'd heard the breathless enthusiasm with which the fans spoke
    of their gear, but I'd delayed taking the plunge myself because
    I've never been comfortable on the standard form factor shared by
    nearly all mechanical keyboards. After being hit by RSI in
    college, I went from the ergonomic-but-cheap Microsoft Natural
    keyboard to the
    good-for-a-rubber-dome <a href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/freestyle2.htm/">Kinesis
    Freestyle</a>[<a href="#fn1">1</a>], which had a lousy key response but was the best I
    could find for under US$100. For a long time the only mechanical
    split keyboard I could find was the
    legendary <a href="http://www.kinesis-ergo.com/advantage.htm">Kinesis
    Advantage</a>, which apart from its US$300 price tag kept me at
    bay due to its massive size&mdash;I work from <a href="/156">local
    coffee shops</a> frequently, and the Advantage is just too clunky
    to toss in a bag and tote around.</p>

  <p>But over the summer someone on the <tt>#emacs</tt> freenode
    channel brought my attention to the
    mysterious <a href="http://ergodox.org">Ergodox</a> project.</p>

  <img src="/i/ergodox-1.png" alt="ergodox" />

  <p>The Ergodox is a project to create a freely-licensed ergonomic
    mechanical keyboard design that can be built by anyone. The site,
    while very sparse on details of what's really going on, contains
    links to <a href="http://ergodox.org/Hardware.aspx">everything you
    need</a> to source and assemble your own keyboard. Apart from a
    parts list, the schematics for the printed circuit board are
    freely downloadable and GPL-licensed. The casing comes in
    3D-printed and laser-cut acrylic variants you can have constructed
    at <a href="http://wiki.metrixcreatespace.com/">your local maker
    space</a>,
    and <a href="https://github.com/benblazak/ergodox-firmware">the
    firmware is on GitHub</a>.</p>

  <p>This is great news for the adventurous maker, but I've only
    got <a href="/171">the most basic experience building
    electronics</a>. Sourcing all those parts and getting the circuit
    board <a href="http://oshpark.com/">printed</a> myself felt
    daunting. Luckily I discovered a company
    called <a href="http://www.massdrop.com">Massdrop</a> was
    organizing group buys which could get all the parts needed at a
    significant discount. The only problem was the group buys only
    opened up for a limited time, and there was a pretty serious
    turnaround time before delivery. As my luck had it I got in on a
    group buy which hit some snags in the fulfillment process and
    ended up having to wait from August to December for my kit to
    arrive. (I later found out there's another group buy to get just the
    circuit boards, which would have been an interesting way to go.)
    But to my great delight it finally came last week.</p>

    <img src="/i/ergodox-assembly.jpg" alt="assembly" align="left" /></a>

  <p>For the drop I participated in Massdrop offered an optional
    partial assembly service. For a small fee the board would have all
    the diodes and the microcontroller pre-soldered, so you'd only
    have to solder the switches. Since the diodes are of the
    tiny <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-mount_technology">surface-mount</a>
    variety, previous bad experience with surface-mount components
    prompted me to opt for the partial assembly. This ended up
    resulting in several extra weeks of delay, and for the most recent drop
    the assembly options have not been offered. But once I got my kit,
    soldering the switches only took around an hour. After another ten
    minutes I had all the caps on[<a href="#fn2">2</a>] (with some help as pictured) and
    the case assembled and was ready to
    roll. I've <a href="http://rossipedia.com/blog/2013/06/ergodox-mechanical-keyboard-review/">heard</a>
    <a href="http://jaymatter.com/blog/2013/12/01/ergodox/">reports</a>
    of others that were new to soldering were able to handle the SMD
    diodes without too much trouble, so maybe my concern was
    unwarranted. But adding in time for the diodes does bring the
    total assembly time up to five or six hours. Massdrop
    provides <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/ext/ergodox/assembly">detailed
    instructions</a> covering the assembly process, and various users
    have created video tutorials as well.</p>

  <p>I mentioned
    the <a href="https://github.com/benblazak/ergodox-firmware">hackable
    firmware</a> earlier&mdash;this is really one of the things that
    sets the Ergodox apart. The keyboard embeds
    a <a href="http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/index.html">Teensy 2
    board</a>, an 8-bit Arduino-compatible microcontroller with more
    processing power
    than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer">the
    computers that took the Apollo projects to the moon</a>. Massdrop
    helpfully provides a
    fantastic <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/ext/ergodox">web-based
    configuration tool</a> that can compile and spit out firmware for
    the microcontroller based on the keys you've specified.</p>

  <a href="https://www.massdrop.com/ext/ergodox/?referer=NCVLBE&hash=388aaf52db3e7e0fd3efd99d2d007458">
    <img src="/i/ergodox-layout.png" alt="my current layout" /></a>

  <p>I've got it configured with a basic dvorak layout with several of
    my more commonly-used function keys around the edges of the thumb
    clusters. As a lisp hacker it was exciting for me to have
    unshifted parentheses keys on my thumbs. As
    a <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit">Paredit</a>
    user I put the open paren closer to the thumb resulting in a
    weird-looking backwards configuration, because I rarely hit the
    close paren key. (Unfortunately unshifted parentheses can't be
    added in the web configurator; you have
    to <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/ergodox-firmware/commit/6e0409d">patch
    and build</a> the firmware yourself. I had a Teensy development
    environment set up
    from <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43319799@N00/9522005426">a
    previous project</a> so this wasn't a big deal for me, but the
    convenience of the web configurator is very much appreciated when
    getting started.) Having enter and backspace on the thumbs is
    handy, but I found the outer layer of the thumb cluster is too far
    to hit when touch-typing, so putting my music controls there made
    sense. The code also supports shifting to other layers if you
    need more space. So far I've been comfortable with mostly just one
    layer, but I have a second layer with the full set of function
    keys and arrows for the rare occasions when those are needed.</p>

  <p>The feel of a keyboard is obviously a really subjective
    thing. There's no one-size-fits-all, but
    the <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Cherry_MX_Blue">Cherry MX
    blue switches</a> are really growing on me and already bring me
    some disappointment when I have to go back to my internal Thinkpad
    keyboard. But the layout takes a lot of getting used to. In
    particular the fact that it's staggered vertically instead of
    horizontally makes for an awkward adjustment period. Early
    typewriter designers staggered each row in order to avoid jams
    when the levers came up to strike the paper. Like many other
    quirks of early technology, this design has stuck around far
    longer than the reasons behind it. The Ergodox staggers each
    column instead in order to match up with human physiology: each
    finger is of a different length, so the column for the middle and
    longest finger is shifted up a bit higher, etc. It makes a lot of
    sense, but even after several days of on-and-off usage I still
    make lots of typos on the bottom row of my left hand. Though it's
    more effective to move lots of things over to the thumbs, I
    recommend leaving things like control, tab, and shift where you're
    used to them until you get over the disorientation of the new
    alignment.</p>

    <img src="/i/ergodox-colored-caps.jpg" alt="colored caps" /></a>

  <p>The Ergodox project appeals to me on a lot of levels: the open
    licensing[<a href="#fn3">3</a>], the customizablility, the
    hands-on electronics[<a href="#fn4">4</a>], and the
    unconventional, human-oriented design. It's probably not for
    everyone, but if you've a professional programmer who's never
    given your keyboard a second thought, maybe it's time to broaden
    your horizons. They should be opening up the group buy for another
    batch in the near future...</p>

  <p><b>Update</b>: I've <a href="/173">designed by own keyboard</a>,
    which is meant to be a smaller, more travel-friendly complement to
    the Ergodox that shares a lot of its characteristics.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>[<a name="fn1">1</a>] Though I can hardly stand the mushy key
    response these days, I have a soft spot in my heart for the MS
    Natural 4000 since it brought me significant relief from my RSI
    symptoms. Using it for several months taught me to angle my hands
    in correctly, a habit that I was able to take with me even when I
    started using other keyboards. Originally I kept my hands
    positioned like the photo below, but the shape of the
    Natural taught me to angle my fingers differently (pinky curled in
    and index finger extended out) so I could keep my wrists straight
    and still have my fingers rest in the home row position.</p>

  <img src="/i/bad-angle.jpg" alt="bad angle" style="float: left" />

  <p>That said if you are looking for a comfortable keyboard and
    aren't ready to spend over US$100 for something mechanical I would
    recommend the Kinesis Freestyle; even though it's still a
    rubber-dome switch it's got a crisper response than most and
    allows for you to keep your forearms totally straight.</p>

  <p>[<a name="fn3">2</a>] The DSA (spherically-shaped cupped tops)
    keycap set that Massdrop offers doesn't include "homing bumps" for
    the keys under the index fingers, making it a bit tricky to get
    your bearing on the keyboard without looking down at your hands. I
    picked up a couple white caps with homing dots from Signature
    Plastics (matching black wasn't an option) and then went ahead and
    swapped the rest of the home-row with white as well along with a
    nice bright red Esc just for good measure. The only further
    hardware modification I have planned is changing out the switches
    under the pinky modifiers
    with <a href="http://deskthority.net/wiki/Cherry_MX_Brown">Cherry
    MX brown</a> switches, which require less force and should reduce
    pinky fatigue.</p>

  <p><b>Update</b>: I've replaced the switches on the outermost
    columns: the modifiers (shifts and ctrl next to the A key) are
    Cherry MX reds (lower-force and no tactile bump) since I don't
    feel like tactile response makes sense for modifiers. For the
    non-modifiers I'm using browns which are tactile and lower-force
    without being loud; the idea was to reduce strain on the weak
    pinky fingers. I don't feel like the browns make all that much of
    a difference, but I like the feel of having linear switches for
    modifiers. I've also replaced the modifiers under my thumbs with
    Cherry MX black switches, which are like the reds but with heavier
    springs since the thumb is the strongest finger.</p>

  <p>[<a name="fn3">3</a>] There have already been a number of further
    designs based on the Ergodox design, including
    the <a href="http://deskthority.net/workshop-f7/acidfire-s-custom-keyboard-aka-the-grand-piano-t6019.html">"Grand
    Piano"</a> and
    this <a href="http://blog.fsck.com/2013/12/better-and-better-keyboards.html">incredible
    string of prototypes</a> culminating in a
    soon-to-be-kickstarted <a href="http://keyboard.io">production run
    at http://keyboard.io</a>.</p>

  <p>[<a name="fn4">4</a>] What's really eye-opening about putting a
    keyboard together is that you discover there's really no magic
    behind it. It's just a grid of switches wired into a
    microcontroller. Since microcontrollers don't have enough pins to
    detect each switch individually, there's a
    clever <a href="http://pcbheaven.com/wikipages/How_Key_Matrices_Works/">matrix
    wiring</a> employed; each hand has six rows and seven columns
    where each row and column is wired to a pin. The microcontroller
    then scans each column by bringing all the column outputs except
    one low and then checking to see which row inputs are high. It can
    only technically scan one column at a time, but it's able to
    rotate through them so quickly that it's indistinguishable from
    simultaneous reads to a human. The same multiplexing approach is
    used for controlling
    an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_matrix#LED_matrix">LED
    matrix</a> with a limited number of pins. It's all there in the
    code for when you get curious.</p>
