title: in which the events of and surrounding cabooseconf are recapitulated

content: "<p>Over the weekend I spent some time with thousands of geeks
  in Portland as RailsConf was held at the Oregon Convention
  Center. While I always enjoy these kinds of events immensely, I
  usually have just as much fun with the socializing aspect as I
  do with the actual conference material. So this year I decided just
  to head over to <a href='http://conference.caboose.org'>CabooseConf</a> 
  and only attend the &quot;hallway track&quot; at the main event.</p>

  <p>As usual, Portland was the ideal host city for the
  conference. It's beautifully green in a way that makes it simply
  refreshing to walk through. The convenience of getting around would
  have been better for me personally if I had thought to book a hotel
  closer to the Max line, but no US city that I've been to does
  visitor-friendly better than Portland. It came as a major
  disappointment to hear that it might head to the wastelands of
  Nevada next year&mdash;yuck.</p>
  
  <p>CabooseConf was a really low-key string of hackfests put on by
  the folks at <a href='http://entp.com'>ENTP</a>. Even if it didn't
  seem too lively at first glance, the room kept humming with a quiet
  energy of hackers working on big ideas. Getting that many bright
  people together is bound to spark all the right kinds of
  conversations.</p>
  
  <p>I greatly enjoyed finally getting to meet
  <a href='http://blog.jdhuntington.com'>JD</a>, the other main Bus
  Scheme contributor and welcoming the enthusiastic
  <a href='http://6brand.com/'>Jack Danger Canty</a> to the team. I
  had hoped to start adding support for macros to Bus Scheme, but the
  work I started in that direction revealed some weaknesses deep in
  the implementation. The code has much more internal consistency now
  (we changed a huge amount of code over from using Arrays to
  internally represent code to using Lists) and is pretty solid. Jack
  has actually deployed <a href='http://jackcanty.com/'>the first Bus
  Scheme web app in the wild</a> as his home page, which is a
  noteworthy milestone. I've begun support for macros but am still a
  ways away from getting that totally ready. Scheme macros are fairly
  different from Common Lisp or Elisp's version, so it's taken some
  learning.</p>
  
  <p>If you've read anything about RailsConf this year, you've
  doubtless heard a lot of people excited about MagLev, a new upcoming
  Ruby implementation. Since I didn't go to any of the talks I didn't
  see the demo, but
  I've <a href='http://headius.blogspot.com/2008/06/maglev.html'>read
  enough</a> to be skeptical. I know for a fact that the world of
  Smalltalk has a lot of amazing technology around it that would
  really benefit Rubyists. But the way people go on about MagLev like
  it's going to solve everyone's problems with its 60x performance
  boost is really short-sighted. The obvious bit is that they haven't
  given anyone any reason to think they've got a system that supports
  Ruby's object model and execution semantics on anything other than a
  very superficial level. It's easy to optimize microbenchmarks to get
  60x speed boosts like MagLev claims if you don't allow for the
  dynamicity of Ruby, and MagLev has so far made no claims towards
  being able to run (let alone pass) any of the Ruby specs.</p>
  
  <p>But this is really just a side-effect of the real
  problem: There is absolutely no transparency into the development
  cycle of MagLev. We're seeing a group of engineers who are grounded
  in a 1980's mindset of &quot;let's demo this technology we're working on
  to a bunch of potential customers&quot; rather than entering into the
  Ruby community and approaching us as a group of hackers. We don't
  value slick demos and impressive statistics; <b>we value code</b>
  and code alone. We have learned the mistakes of single-vendor
  reliance, some of us by observation and some of us by painful
  experience. Even Sun learned that people won't put up with
  it. No&mdash;even <i>Microsoft</i> isn't daring to suggest that you
  use a Ruby implementation that ties you into their proprietary
  software stack.</p>

  <p>The really crazy thing about the whole issue is that it reveals
  an idea that somehow it's difficult to make money with a really
  excellent piece of free software. It blows my mind that people still
  think this in AD 2008. People will trip over themselves to get a
  good place in line to throw buckets of cash at you if you can
  provide them with an open-source software stack that comes anywhere
  near the 8x-60x speedup that MagLev has implied is possible. It
  grows even more obvious when you think about the fact that the other
  big win with MagLev is the OODB, something that very few Rubyists
  have any idea how to deal with. And Gemstone has the expertise
  needed to port our Rails applications from this hacky
  object-relational mapping model to their vastly more elegant and
  scalable paradigm. It would be hard for them <i>not</i> to make
  money in a situation where MagLev came under a reasonable Free
  license.</p>"
