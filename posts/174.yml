title: in which cards are stacked
id: 174
content: |-
  <p> My childhood summers involved many days spent building out
    expansive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">HyperCard</a>
    stacks to explore in a game world that spanned across cities
    and islands and galaxies, littered with creatively absurd death
    scenes to keep you on your toes. The instant accessibility of
    HyperCard invited you to explore and create without feeling
    intimidated. Especially for younger minds, I believe there's
    something fundamental about the spatial aspect of HyperCard. Every
    button has its place, and rather than creating an abstract
    hierarchy of classes or a mesh of interconnected modules, you can
    see that buttons have a specific place on a card, which exist
    "inside" a stack in a metaphor that maps to the way we already
    perceive the world.</p>

  <p>While <a href="http://www.loper-os.org/?p=568">Apple killed
    HyperCard off many years ago</a>, there exist tools for children
    today that maintain this accessible spatial
    arrangement. I've <a href="/167">written before</a> about how my
    kids love playing
    with <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>, a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_%28programming_language%29">Logo</a>-descendant
    providing colorful sprites and drag-and-drop scripts to animate
    them. While this is unbeatable for the early years, (especially
    for kids who are only just beginning to learn to read) eventually
    you hit an abstraction ceiling beyond which it becomes very
    tedious to express your ideas due to its non-textual nature. There
    are modern HyperCard clones
    like <a href="http://livecode.com">LiveCode</a>, which offers a
    very sophisticated platform, but falls prey to the same tragic
    pitfall of attempting to
    build <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperTalk">an
    "English-like" programming language</a>, an endeavour which has
    been attempted many times but
    always <a href="http://andykonwinski.com/applescript-the-most-unnatural-natural-language/">ends
    in tears</a>.</p>

  <p>So as I've thought a good next step for my own children, we
    happened to start playing the
    game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst">Myst</a>. Given
    my children's proclivities, this was immediately followed by Myst
    copycat worlds drawn out in elaborate detail with pen and paper the
    next day. I thought of what I could do to bring back the
    exploration and creativity of HyperCard, and eventually I got to
    <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/cooper">building my own
    implementation</a>.</p>

  <p>The natural choice for this project was definitely
    the <a href="http://racket-lang.org">Racket</a> language. While
    I'm much more familiar with Clojure, it's a very poor fit for a
    first-time programmer, especially at a young age. Racket boasts
    lots of great learning material, but beyond the texts there's
    just an ever-present focus on usability and clarity that shines
    through in all aspects of the language and community.</p>

  <p>Racket's roots lie with the famously-minimalistic Scheme, but it's grown
    to be a much more practical, expansive programming language. While
    there are still a few places in which its imperative roots show
    through, it has good support for functional programming and
    encourages good functional practice by default for the most
    part. (I hope to do a future post on a few ways to improve on its
    FP, both via
    the <a href="https://github.com/greghendershott/rackjure">Rackjure</a>
    library and some
    of <a href="http://p.hagelb.org/fstruct.rkt.html">my own
    hacks</a>.) But what really sets Racket apart is its solid tooling
    and libraries. I wouldn't put my kids down in front of Emacs, but
    Racket ships
    with <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/index.html">a
    very respectable IDE</a> that's capable and helpful without being
    overwhelming. The GUI and drawing libraries that come with Racket
    have proven to be very useful and approachable for what I've done
    so far.</a>

  <p>So
    far <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/cooper">Cooper</a>, my
    HyperCard clone, is fairly simplistic. But in just over 500 lines
    of code, I have a system that supports manipulating stacks of cards,
    drawing backgrounds on them, and laying out buttons which can
    either navigate to other cards or invoke arbitrary functions.</p>

  <p>It's not sophisticated, but my children have already shown plenty
    of interest in using it to build out small worlds of their own in
    the cards. They've so far been willing to put up with lots of
    glitches and poor performance to bring their imaginations to life,
    and I'm hoping that this can gradually grow into a deeper
    understanding of how to think in a logical, structured way.</p>
