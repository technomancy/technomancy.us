title: in which local hacking locations are surveyed

  <p>I'm lucky to have the chance to do my job remotely from wherever
    I like. Half the time I work out
    of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/technomancy/tags/laboratory">my
    code lab</a>, which is a converted shed in my back yard. But I
    venture out fairly frequently to local coffee shops. Here are a
    few of my favourites. I should mention that I'm a big fan of
    single-origin pour-over brews, so the list is biased in favour of
    places which serve that well rather than the more traditional
    espresso drinks. All these have at least one location in North
    Seattle.</p>

  <h4><a href="http://neptunecoffee.com">Neptune</a></h4>

  <p>I'm here a lot because it's the only one on this list I don't
    need to get on the freeway for. The decor is a bit sparse, but
    they're quite friendly here and serve a mean pour-over.
    They've been known to even
    serve <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbqJKDZNyic">syphon-brewed
    coffee</a>, which is always a treat to watch when they fire up the
    bunsen burner. The proprietor also
    runs <a href="http://tehcoffee.com/">tehcoffee.com</a>, a site for
    competition-level baristas can rank and review others. The
    Greenwood neighborhood is great too; lots of lunch options and
    bookstores to browse. Bonus fact: Allie, the inventor
    of <a href="http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html">the
    mythical Alot beast</a> has a blend here named after her.</p>

  <h4><a href="http://www.milsteadandco.com/">Milstead & Co.</a></h4>

  <p>This one has only opened relatively recently, but it's made a
    splash for a number of things, not the least of which is the
    spectacular waterfront view from under the Aurora bridge. The
    selection here is excellent; this is the only place on this list
    that serves beans from multiple roasters, and they offer plenty of
    variety in brewing methods. The interior is spacious with high
    ceilings; it's very inviting. Mr. Milstead himself is usually
    around, and his excitement about his craft is infectious and
    obvious once you get him talking. I'd be here all the time if it
    weren't the furthest (south) from where I live.</p>

  <h4><a href="http://zokacoffee.com">Zoka</a></h4>

  <p>This one is my go-to place. I often run into people I know here,
    (and sometimes <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/">people I
    don't</a>), and we hold
    the <a href="http://seajure.github.com">Seattle Clojure group</a>
    meetings here as well. The University District location in
    particular works well for meetings just because it's so spacious;
    I don't think I've ever seen a larger coffee shop. It's a popular
    place for students to study, so it's pretty quiet in the back. It
    can be crowded at times though, probably based on the school
    schedule. They've got a great selection sourced from all over the
    world that rotates every so often. It's always fun to
    read <a href="http://www.zokacoffee.com/blog/2011/03/jeffs-trip-to-nicaragua.html">their
    blog posts about traveling to visit the growers</a>. The "Zoka
    bars" they serve here are a ridiculously rich treat. The decor
    here is very warm and comfortable with wood paneling
    everywhere.</p>

  <img src="i/trabant.jpg" alt="trabant" align="left" />

  <h4><a href="http://trabantcoffee.com">Trabant</a></h4>

  <p>I don't come here often because the parking situation is awful,
    but if you are in the area (or taking the bus), definitely check
    out Trabant. They've got good chai, but the thing that keeps
    bringing me back here is
    the <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/drink/2008/03/could_a_coffee_maker_be_worth_11000.html">Clover
    machine</a>. This contraption is capable of extracting rich
    flavours out of a bean like nothing else. Unfortunately Starbucks
    purchased the company that sold them, so there aren't very many
    places with Clovers that offer good beans. (As the owner of
    Trabant said about the acquisition, "wearing Air Jordans doesn't
    make you play like Michael Jordan.") Anyway, the downtown Trabant
    is very spare, minimalist, and quiet, while the one in the
    University district (pictured) is bustling and quirky.</p>

  <h4>Honorable Mentions</h4>

  <dl>
    <dt><a href="http://www.espressovivace.com/">Vivace</a></dt>
    <dd>I'm of the opinion that Vivace has the best espresso in
      Seattle. It's too far for me to visit regularly, but members of
      the famed
      <a href="http://seattlerb.org">Seattle Ruby Brigade</a> can
      often be found working here in the afternoon.</dd>

    <dt><a href="http://www.seattlecoffeeworks.com/">Seattle Coffee Works</a></dt>
    <dd>I've only been here a couple times, but I was floored by
      their Yirgacheffe both times. They serve their pour-overs at a
      separate "slow bar" where the baristas are happy to geek out
      over their creations if you show interest. Again, this one's
      too far away (Pike St.) to make me a regular.</dd>

    <dt><a href="http://www.greenbeancoffee.org/">Green Bean</a></dt>
    <dd>This one is actually a non-profit which supports a number of
      other non-profits on a rotating basis. The staff here are really
      friendly. I like to come here early and get breakfast with my
      family since they've got a kids' corner.</dd>

    <dt><a href="http://www.chocolati.com/">Chocolati</a></dt>
    <dd>I don't even come here for their coffee, but their hot
      chocolate is superb. They've also got great truffles. The
      Greenwood location is a converted house that offers plenty of
      space to work, while the Greenlake location is a lot smaller but
      has nice views of the water.</dd>

  <p>Enjoy!</p>
