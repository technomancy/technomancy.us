  the gaps in functionality are a bit less crippling. But the more
  interesting bit is that it's hosted at a publicly accessible
  repository now,  so you can grab it if you're interested.</p>

<pre class='code'>
$ git clone git://git.caboo.se/bus_scheme.git
</pre>

<p>I've submitted a <a
href='http://bus-scheme.rubyforge.org'>rubyforge project</a>,  and it
should get approved soon so I can upload to it. At that point gem
installation should be possible with an ordinary,  everyday <tt>sudo
gem install bus-scheme</tt>.</p>

<p>At this point there are still some pretty hairy problems with
  scope; the implementation is as na&iuml;eve as possible. Lexically
  scoped it is not,  and closures are a ways off still. Basic &lambda;
  functionality is a go. You can peek at <a href='http://git.caboo.se/?p=bus_scheme.git;a=blob;f=test/test_eval.rb;hb=7cd761db8b353e2a556d3c182d78b40c1a6e2164'>some</a> <a
  href='http://git.caboo.se/?p=bus_scheme.git;a=blob;f=test/test_parser.rb;hb=7cd761db8b353e2a556d3c182d78b40c1a6e2164'>tests</a> to see how far along it is. Everything
  uncommented should pass; commented tests mean \"to do\" items.</p>

<p>Also,  I've tested it out and it works in Ruby 1.8,  Ruby 1.9,  and
  Rubinius. A few folks on the Rubinius team have expressed interest
  in getting it to compile down to Rubinius bytecode,  which would be
  pretty exciting.</p>

<p><b>Much thanks</b> go to <a href='http://blog.caboo.se'>Courtenay</a> and <a href='http://scie.nti.st'>Garry</a> for helping get the repository public.</p>

<p>REPL it up!</p>
