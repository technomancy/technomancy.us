  <p>I just got a new laptop, and while I wouldn't post about it
    normally I've had a number of people ask me what I thought of it.
    For the last five years or so I've been a Thinkpad user
    exclusively, but the latest models of their lightweight X series
    have offered disappointing screens with 1366x786 being the only
    resolution option. Since my dignity prevents me from buying a
    laptop with fewer vertical pixels than my phone, I broadened my
    search this time around and came across the 13-inch Samsung Series
    9, aka NP900X3B.</p>

  <p><b>Update August 2012:</b> I've gone back to the Thinkpad after
    getting it repaired. I realized after a month or so with the
    Samsung that the ultra-thin profile is actually an anti-feature. I
    like my laptops small, but I realized that weight is really the
    only thing I care about in that category. There are no concrete
    benefits to be had from a thin design, while fact that it forces a
    shallow, uncomfortable keyboard, inaccessible battery, less-sturdy
    chassis, and hard-wired SSD are very tangible drawbacks. I
    definitely do miss the brilliant screen, but I'm glad to be on a
    machine that doesn't sacrifice functionality for looks. If you're
    considering a Series 9, I'd say it's much better than most
    laptops on the market. If you're coming from a Macbook, the
    keyboard and inaccessible battery might not bother you, but I'd
    encourage you to take a look at the Thinkpad X series too.</p>

  <p>At first the most striking thing about it is its thin profile,
    but once you've started using it you realize it's the screen that
    really sets it apart. Samsung is the largest manufacturer of LCDs
    in the world, so it makes sense that the screen would be the
    distinguishing factor on their high-end models. The resolution is
    1600x900, which I couldn't find in anything else smaller than 14
    inches, but it's the 400 cd/m<sup>2</sup> of brightness that
    really sets it apart. With summer right around the corner, this
    perfect
    for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/technomancy/tags/remoteoffice/">working
    outdoors</a>.</p>

  <p>While I'm pretty thrilled with the new machine, the thin profile
    forces some difficult compromises with the keyboard. It's of the
    standard chicklet design, which is a drag coming from the
    Thinkpad. The X200s Thinkpad I was using previously had a very
    comfortable response and depth to it that you don't find with
    most chicklet keyboards. The Samsung also lacks a trackpoint, drainage
    tray, and dedicated volume buttons. The X200s isn't appreciably
    heavier than the Samsung; (only ½ a pound more) but it is over
    twice as thick. Personally if it's light enough I don't find
    thickness to be a problem; I'd much rather have a comfortable
    keyboard than a 0.4-inch profile. But it does turn heads.</p>

  <p>The speakers on ultraportable laptops like the X200s typically
    come across as a token effort to fill a feature checkbox, but the
    Samsung's are fairly respectable. I was pleased to see the lack of
    the hardware wifi kill switch that plagued me on my Thinkpad. It's
    also got a bigger selection of ports than you'd expect with the
    slim profile: USB 2, USB 3, micro-HDMI, combined mic/headphones,
    and Ethernet, though the latter must be used with the provided
    adapter.</p>

  <p>I'm running Debian Wheezy on it because I
    read <a href="http://www.ing.unitn.it/~zatelli/linux/samsung.html">on
    a blog post</a> that a newer kernel was needed for the wifi
    drivers, but apparently this was only the case with an earlier
    model of the Series 9 that used the Broadcom chipset; The NP900X3B
    uses an Intel chipset that has been well-supported for some time.
    Everything worked perfectly out of the box except the keys for
    adjusting the keyboard backlight. The camera, external monitor
    port, and multitouch trackpad work as you'd expect. The suspend
    functionality, which has traditionally lagged behind Mac OS X,
    resumes in a couple short seconds.</p>

  <p>While I would love to see this same screen on a laptop with the
    luxurious keyboard, carbon fiber body, and replaceable battery of a
    Thinkpad, the Series 9 is quite slick and should keep me happy for a
    number of years.</p>
