title: in which the maintainer's perspective is considered

  <p>In the past few months I've had a number of contributions pour in
    for some of my projects. It's been really exciting to see this
    level of community involvement, and I try to do everything I can
    to encourage users to get involved in development. But I don't
    have a lot of free time these days&mdash;with two small kids I'm
    lucky to have a few hours a week to address incoming patches, much
    less work on new features.</p>

       title="(dramatization)" />

  <p>There are a few things that could streamline the process a bit,
    so I thought I'd take some time to explain how these projects look
    from the maintainer's side and the things that contributors could
    do to make their patches easy to apply.</p>

  <h4>Coordinating</h4>

  <p>For simple stuff it's great just to get patches out of the
    blue. For more involved work, however, it's important to
    communicate so that parallel feature work doesn't interfere. For
    my projects, there are few enough people working on them that
    usually mentioning it on the mailing list is plenty. Larger
    projects will often track in-progress features using a ticket
    system, so in that case you'll probably want to do both. Then
    you can fork/checkout the project and get started.</p>

  <h4>Branches</h4>

  <p>The first thing to remember is to keep all your work in topic
    branches. Most people just commit directly to the master branch,
    but then it's trickier for them to keep in sync with
    upstream. Every time you pull in the latest changes it causes a
    merge commit. This needlessly clutters up the history and makes it
    difficult for maintainers to find the exact changes they are
    looking for. It gets worse if there are multiple unrelated
    features committed directly to master. Even once your changes are
    merged, it's likely that pulling changes after that point will
    still result in merge commits rather than fast-forwards simply
    because the same set of changes were applied in a different
    order. So keeping your work in a separate branch per feature/fix
    allows the master history to be kept clean.</p>

  <p>When it's time for a maintainer to merge your branch, they have a
    choice to either rebase it on top of the current master and then
    commit it, maintaining a linear history, or merge it in to master
    with a single merge commit. The latter is usually done in the case
    of longer-lived branches where you want to be able to group
    together a whole series of commits under a single feature. It's a
    bit silly/noisy to leave a merge commit lying around from merging
    a branch with only one or two commits.</p>

  <h4>Cleanliness</h4>

  <p>I'm a little more picky about the silly little things than most
    maintainers; I prefer my projects to be free of trailing
    whitespace and to use 80-column width, standard indentation, and
    no tabs. It's easy enough to enforce this in Emacs:</p>

  <pre class="code">(setq whitespace-style '(trailing lines space-before-tab
                            indentation space-after-tab)
        whitespace-line-column 80)

    <span class="comment-delimiter">;; </span><span class="comment">add hooks for every major mode you use
  </span>(add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook (<span class="keyword">lambda</span> () (whitespace-mode 1)))</pre>

  <p>In an ideal world, projects would have great test coverage and
    bugfix patches would always include first a test that fails in
    order to highlight the problem the patch addresses, then the
    implementation that causes the test to pass. Many of my projects
    unfortunately fall into the tricky-to-test zone either by way of
    complex asynchronous I/O or UI-heavy pieces of code, making this
    ideal difficult to achieve. In any case, it gives maintainers much
    more confidence when applying a patch if they can use tests to
    verify it's behaving as intended. It just takes a big burden off
    the person performing the merge if they only have to manually
    verify that the test passes and makes sense rather than checking
    by hand that the implementation is behaving as expected.</p>

  <p>I've found that in Clojure it's good to aim for function bodies
    of ten lines or less, modulo exception handling and
    logging. Naturally there will be places where this isn't
    practical, but it's good to keep this in mind and carefully
    examine longer functions to see if there would be a cleaner way to
    break things up. It should go without saying that using pure
    functions as much as possible and consolidating all I/O and
    mutation into a few places will also help a great deal to make
    things easier to read.</p>

  <h4>Sending it off</h4>

  <p>Personally I find it easiest to work with changes that are
    published to a remote git repository. Generally this means people
    create forks on Github, but there's no reason other options
    like <a href="http://gitorious.org">Gitorious</a> or even a
    self-hosted git repo wouldn't work. Github pull requests work
    well, although please do <em>not</em> send them without a message
    explaining what the changes do. Github has a "feature" whereby you
    can send pull requests to everyone with a fork of a project; this
    is a terrible, terrible thing that you should never use. Most of
    the people on that list forked the project months and months ago
    and forgot about it, so please don't spam them.</p>

  <p>Some people prefer to just mail patches or attach patches to bug
    tracker tickets. It's easy to generate these patches by
    running <kbd>git format-patch master</kbd> from your topic
    branch.</p>

  <p>And it's an unfortunate fact of life that some projects require
    copyright assignment before they can accept nontrivial patches, so
    check for that first. In some cases a paper form is even required,
    which can bring a further unexpected delay into the picture.</p>

  <h4>Commit Access</h4>

  <p>In some cases I know I'm just not able to give a project the
    attention it deserves and I volunteer certain contributors for the
    post of maintainer. Sometimes this is because I just can't give a
    project the attention it needs to keep up with incoming patches,
    and sometimes (as with Hugo Duncan and his excellent work
    on <a href="http://github.com/technomancy/swank-clojure/tree/swank-break">swank-clojure
    break</a>) it's because I just don't want to be a bottleneck
    keeping their awesome work from getting in.</p>

  <p>In these cases I like to ask that changes don't get merged to
    master until they've been reviewed by at least one person other
    than the author. If you're a committer that's applying patches
    someone else sent in, then you're doing the review, otherwise just
    try to get some help from IRC or the project's mailing list to
    review your patch before it makes it to master.</p>

  <p>All that said, keep the patches coming! I love getting them.</p>
