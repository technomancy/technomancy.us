title: in which hardware heats things up

  <p>As a remote hacker, I spend a fair bit of time in
    my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/technomancy/tags/laboratory">code
    lab</a> when I'm
    not <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/technomancy/tags/remoteoffice">out
    and about around Seattle</a>. It's great to have a space away from
    the rest of the house where I can work in isolation, but around
    this time of year in the Northern hemisphere the temperatures
    start to drop. I've had a powerful wall heater in the lab for a
    while now, but some days I'd be a little reluctant to head out
    across the frost-covered lawn since the heater takes 20-30 minutes
    before it really gets things comfortable on a cold day.</p>

  <p>I've
    been <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/43319799@N00/9522005426">getting
    my feet wet with hardware hacking</a> the past few months, so to
    me the problem was practically begging to be solved with a little
    applied technology. Of course there are plenty of of-the-shelf
    devices that can toggle a 110V outlet, but the particular heater
    I'm using is wired directly into 220V mains, calling for a custom
    solution. I recently built
    a <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/technomancy/10982587913/">binary
    clock for my car</a> using a Raspberry Pi, so I'd had a bit of
    experience with embedded Linux boards. For this project I ended up
    choosing
    the <a href="http://beagleboard.org/Products/BeagleBone%20Black">BeagleBone
    Black</a>, an impressive board costing only US$10 more than the Pi
    but packing in a lot more power as well as boasting a Creative
    Commons-licensed hardware design. Of course an Arduino could have
    worked here too, but once you add Ethernet to the cost of an Uno
    it ends up costing nearly as much and would have offered much
    more limited language and library support.</p>

  <p>I ended up with this little board running Debian with
    an <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/165">temperature
    sensor</a> in its analog input and
    a <a href="http://www.fotek.com.hk/solid/SSR-1.htm">solid-state
    relay</a> hooked up to one of the GPIO pins. The analog input is
    the main thing that makes this a much better fit for the
    BeagleBone than a Pi; all the inputs on the Pi are digital, which
    would have made reading the temperature more
    complicated. Unfortunately the input to the relay won't trigger
    with less than 7.5ma, so it was necessary to hook it into SYS 5V
    (the taped wire above) and toggle it by way of an NPN transistor
    in between the relay's negative terminal and the board's
    ground. Disclaimer: working with mains power is dangerous; be sure
    to switch off the appropriate circuit breaker before you touch any
    of the high-voltage wires.</p>

  <p>In order to control the relay, I put
    together <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/prometheus">an
    Erlang XMPP bot</a> which monitors the current temperature and
    switches the GPIO pin on or off accordingly depending on the
    target temperature. The target temperature can be set by messaging
    the bot, and the current temperature can be queried as well. The
    GitHub repo contains a few schematics along with more detailed
    instructions on how it was built.</p>

  <p>There's still a bit more I'd like to do with it. Right now it's a
    pretty lame Erlang app that doesn't use any fancy OTP features to
    improve reliability, so a lost connection to the XMPP server can
    cause downtime. This is supposedly something OTP makes really
    easy; I just need to read through the appropriate chapters
    in <a href="http://learnyousomeerlang.com">Learn You Some
    Erlang</a>. In addition I'd like to get logging in place; it would
    be useful to be able to plot temperatures over time.</p>

  <p>I'm having a lot of fun with it, and I'm loving how I can just
    walk out to the shed and have it toasty right upon entry. It feels
    like a great practical project where a bit of hacking can really
    make life more convenient.</p>
