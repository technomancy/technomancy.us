  <p>A few years ago I <a href="/152">picked up a bit of OCaml</a> in
    order to put together a small, fast-launching GUI program. I had a
    lot of fun with that specific program, but soon afterward I
    dropped OCaml for general use because it was very awkward to pull
    in third-party code from outside the standard library. A month or
    two ago, a co-worker told me he was learning OCaml and mentioned
    that things had come a long way in the past few years. I was
    pleasantly surprised that not only had
    a <a href="https://realworldocaml.org/">creative-commons licensed
    book</a> been written, but the library situation was vastly
    improved with the introduction
    of <a href="http://opam.ocamlpro.com/">OPAM</a>, a fully
    respectable package manager.</p>

  <p>In my mind OCaml is an excellent complement to Clojure by filling
    many of Clojure's weak places. Startup time, distributable/runtime
    size, type inference, and C integration are all fantastic in OCaml
    but often unsatisfactory in Clojure, while true concurrency, library
    availability, flexible/clear syntax, and size of the community are
    places Clojure has the edge and OCaml is very weak in.</p>

  <p>When we've <a href="http://lein-survey-2013">polled Leiningen
    users</a> in the past, the top complaint has always been startup
    time. Most people just keep a running repl in their editor, but
    this makes certain workflows awkward. My latest project, called
    <a href="http://leiningen.org/grench.html">Grenchman</a>, addresses
    that problem by offering a fast-launching executable that connects
    directly to a running Clojure process and sends it code over the
    <a href="https://github.com/clojure/tools.nrepl">nREPL</a>
    protocol.</p>

  <p>I was able to implement the first release of Grenchman in a few
    weeks with about 400 lines of OCaml while basically re-learning
    the language from scratch with the
    excellent <a href="https://realworldocaml.org/">Real World
    OCaml</a> book. My experience with the language has been very
    positive. Obviously the type system is the primary thing for which
    OCaml is notable, and with good reason. It's unobtrusive for the
    most part, and in my experience nearly every time the compiler
    complained, it was because of something stupid I had done. If
    you've used a static type system without inference, or even one
    that works on locals only, don't let bad experiences there put you
    off&mdash;the seamlessness of full Hindley-Milner inference is
    totally different.</p>

  <p>The widespread use of the
    <a href="https://ocaml.janestreet.com/?q=node/78">Option type</a>
    (often called Maybe in other languages) stands out as a
    particularly helpful feature of the type system. Rather than
    allowing <tt>nil</tt> values to propagate through your program
    until someone tries to do something with them, any operation that
    could fail to return a sensible result requires you to deal with
    it explicitly before it will compile. It's occasionally a little
    more verbose, but it prevents all kinds of shortcuts in less
    strict languages (static and dynamic) that can obscure the root
    cause of subtle bugs. The certainty you get from consistent use
    of <tt>Option</tt> is similar to the easier-to-reason-about
    properties of referential transparency&mdash;there's a dimension
    of error-prone guesswork around failure semantics which simply
    evaporates.</p>

  <img src="i/garden-of-the-gods.jpg" align="left" />
  
  <p>That said, the type system isn't without its trade-offs. Any
    program that does communication with outside systems typically has
    "edges" where the compiler can't infer much about the data which
    originates outside those boundaries. In the case of Grenchman
    there is very little explicit mention of types, but acting on the
    Bencode-formatted messages sent from the Clojure server requires
    some explicit typing. Wrapper types are introduced in order for
    Strings and Lists and so on to be able to partake in the Bencode
    type, and these must be removed before the underlying values can
    be consumed. In more common serialization formats like JSON and
    XML, the wrapping and unwrapping code can be auto-generated from
    schemas, but Bencode is a more obscure format lacking in such
    luxuries.</p>

  <p>The other place types must be made explicit is when interfacing
    with C functions. I used
    the <a href="https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes/">Ctypes</a>
    library in order to make calls
    to <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/readline/">GNU
    Readline</a>, and I greatly appreciated the ability to invoke that
    functionality directly instead of
    using <a href="http://cristal.inria.fr/~ddr/ledit/">a
    port</a>. That said, I had a difficult time getting it to work,
    partly due to the slim documentation and partly due to my own
    unfamiliarity with the calling conventions of C libraries.</p>

  <p>One of the things which drew me to OCaml initially was the
    ability to compile small, easily-distributable native
    executables. This ended up turning out a little differently from
    my expectations for a few reasons. Firstly the use of Ctypes meant
    that I couldn't statically link everything&mdash;Ctypes is built
    upon <a href="https://sourceware.org/libffi/">libffi</a> and
    dynamically loads libreadline, making cross-distribution
    compatibility <a href="http://lists.ocaml.org/pipermail/ctypes/2013-October/000013.html">much
    more complicated</a>. But most OCaml programs won't run into that
    problem unless they need access to C code.</p>

  <p>However, Grenchman is built on
    the <a href="http://janestreet.github.io/">Core and Async</a>
    libraries from <a href="https://ocaml.janestreet.com/">Jane
    Street</a>, one of the largest industrial users of OCaml. Async
    allows for monadic faux-concurrency that avoids a lot of the
    callback headaches of other event-driven tools, but it is fairly
    monolithic. This affects the size of the binaries emitted from
    OCaml's native compiler; even after running <tt>strip(1)</tt> on
    them they were still between 8.5 and 11MB. The book I was using
    cheats a bit and treats Jane Street Core as OCaml's standard
    library, which is nice because it results in code that's a lot
    more consistent and clean than it would be with OCaml's actual
    standard library, but the associated size trade-offs are
    unfortunate, and I wish they had been stated up-front.</p>

  <p>While OPAM is fairly impressive and a huge improvement over the
    state of things two years ago, a couple things about it still
    bother me. One annoyance is that it's entirely source-based, so
    installing new packages can take a very long time. One impressive
    feature of OPAM is that it can handle installation and compilation
    of the OCaml compiler itself (and switching between separate
    versions), but this means pulling in a full dev stack for a given
    project can take as much as an hour. This isn't a huge deal
    though, and if I had to pick one I'd rather have a source-only
    package manager than the other way around. Creating a system that
    reliably deals in both source and binaries is very difficult. More
    worrying is the fact that it seems to encourage a "yeah, just get
    me the latest version of that" approach to versioning rather than
    defaulting to declaring explicit dependency versions. (It's
    possible to pin to specific versions, but this was only mentioned
    in passing, tucked away on the "Advanced" section of the docs, so
    I assume its use is rare.) This pattern is unrealistically
    optimistic in practice and caused lots of headaches in
    Rubygems. It was eventually be abandoned in favour of Bundler, but
    only after a very long and awkward transition phase. Hopefully the
    OCaml community can make this shift more gracefully than the
    Rubyists did by learning from their mistakes.</p>

  <p>I can't say I've written lots of code in OCaml yet, but I've
    really enjoyed it so far. The extra help the compiler gives you
    allowed me to make some fairly major changes in Grenchman with a
    high degree of confidence, and being able to read type signatures
    in the libraries I was using usually made up for a general lack of
    documentation. If you've been thinking about picking up a new
    language, now is a great time to start with OCaml given the book
    and package manager.</p>
