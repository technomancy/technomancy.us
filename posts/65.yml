  <p>A few months ago there was a bit of a fuss about a
    so-called <a href="http://docs.blacktree.com/visor/visor">Quake-style
    terminal emulator</a> for OS X. There's
    a <a href="http://yakuake.uv.ro/">Free alternative</a> if you're
    into KDE and that jazz,  but if you're not it's ridiculously simple
    to hack something up with existing terminal emulators in X. You just
    need to install the <tt>wmctrl</tt> utility: </p>
  
  <pre class="code">
  screenid=<span class="string">`wmctrl -l | grep screen | cut -f 1 -d " "`</span>.chomp.hex
  
  <span class="keyword">if</span> screenid != 0
    puts focused=<span class="string">`xdpyinfo | grep focus | cut -c 16-24`</span>.chomp.hex
    <span class="keyword">if</span> screenid == focused
      <span class="string">`wmctrl -i -r </span><span class="variable-name">#{screenid}</span><span class="string"> -t 9`</span>
    <span class="keyword">else</span>
      <span class="string">`wmctrl -i -R </span><span class="variable-name">#{screenid}</span><span class="string">`</span>
    <span class="keyword">end</span>
  <span class="keyword">else</span>
    <span class="string">`urxvt +sb -fn terminus-16 -bg white -e screen -A -h 10000 -xRR &amp;`</span>
    <span class="comment-delimiter"># </span><span class="comment">replace "-bg white" with "-tr -sh 90 -tint white" for transparency
  </span><span class="keyword">end</span>
  </pre>
  
  <p>I bind this to <tt>M-`</tt> in Sawfish and have some
    window-matching rules that govern the sizing and placement of the
    terminal window as it appears. I'm sure similar results could be
    achieved in other decently flexible window managers.</p>
  
  <pre class="code">
  <span class="paren">(</span>custom-set-typed-variable <span class="paren">(</span>quote match-window-profile<span class="paren">)</span> 
                             <span class="paren">(</span>quote <span class="paren">((((</span>WM_NAME . <span class="string">"^screen$"</span><span class="paren">))</span> 
                                      <span class="paren">(</span>position 20 . 0<span class="paren">)</span> 
                                      <span class="paren">(</span>maximized . horizontal<span class="paren">)</span> 
                                      <span class="paren">(</span>frame-type . none<span class="paren">))))</span> 
                             <span class="paren">(</span>quote match-window<span class="paren">)</span> 
  			   <span class="paren">(</span>quote sawfish.wm.ext.match-window<span class="paren">))</span></pre>
  <p>It's not rocket science or anything,  but I find it comes in handy
    for all kinds of stuff. The wmctrl is a really nice utility if
    you're into optimizing your workflow with automation,  which you
    should be.</p>
