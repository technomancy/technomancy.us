  <p>Well,  Alisha and I
    have <a href='http: //philisha.net/2007/03/big-news/'>been in
      Indonesia</a> now for two weeks. We are really enjoying it; see
    <a href='http: //philisha.net'>the other blog</a> for details.</p>

  <p>My task here has been training the team here and setting up the
    necessary technical infrastructure. First off was
    installing <a href='http: //releases.ubuntu.com'>Feisty Fawn</a>
    (which was serendipitiously released this last Thursday) on a server
    and configuring basic services on that. Previously they have been a
    Microsoft-heavy shop with a bit of PHP,  but they are very eager to
    migrate away from that towards a more flexible,  cost-effective
    platform. The best part about this is that not only does it save a
    lot of money,  it also sets the programmers up to be contributors to
    the global software community rather than simply being
    consumers.</p>
  
  <p>So in addition to the install-fest side of things,  I've done some
    presentations to get the developers up to speed on important
    topics. The first was a "beginning Rails" brief introduction. It's
    not enough to really get a start coding,  but it was enough to whet
    the appetite and make them wish they didn't have to finish up their
    projects in PHP. Enthusiasm is great.</p>
  
  <p>The other presentation is an overview of how to use Trac and
    Subversion to collaborate on projects. It's kind of hard to
    introduce something as fundamental as version control to people
    unfamiliar with it since it's so easy to take things like that for
    granted and hard to approach it from a fresh perspective. Still, 
    getting those habits in place is very important.</p>
  
  <p>I've uploaded <a href='/code/presentations.tar.gz'>the code for the
    presentations</a>. There's not really enough in the slides alone to
    learn from; they rely heavily on a narrator. Still,  they could come
    in handy to someone else in a similar position. Presenting to a
    group is tricky; there are a lot of factors to take into
    account. It's important to know your audience level and find ways to
    keep them engaged. (I wish I had used more images in the Trac
    presentation.)  It's been a lot of fun,  and I've learned a lot about
    how to do this kind of thing,  though I'm looking forward to getting
    into more of the day-to-day coding rather than all this high-level
    stuff.</p>
