  <p>After years of resisting phone ownership followed by a few years
    of owning a 2003-era Nokia dumbphone, I finally decided to make
    the jump when the Nexus One was announced. I've got a strong
    distaste for systems that <a href="http://apple.com/iphone">place
    arbitrary restrictions on their users</a>, and while the Android
    OS itself doesn't have any, many Android phones before the Nexus
    One have had the carriers interfere with the user's control over
    their phone, though not to the same offensive degree as
    Apple. The Nexus One is sold directly through Google without
    giving the carriers a chance to sully it.</p>

  <h3>Daily Usage</h3>

  <p>The screen is just brilliant, and the 800x480 resolution means
    everything is sharp. The OS is very smooth and responsive. Having
    spent so long on a system where the keyboard is king and the mouse
    is only used in exceptional cases, switching to the inverse
    situation on the phone is a bit odd, but not as disorienting as
    you'd expect. Like any handheld keyboard, the Nexus's is bad for
    writing anything longer than a chat, but it's certainly no worse
    than the hardware keyboard on the
    old <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sharp-SL-5500-Zaurus-PDA/dp/B000063D6E">Zaurus</a>
    I toy around with occasionally or the one on my Kindle. The built-in apps work great, and
    if you take the plunge to fully switch to GMail, it pretty much
    makes syncing your mailbox a solved problem.</p>

  <p>There are a few nit picks like the color balance being a bit off
    on the camera, the way the face buttons don't trigger unless you
    push the upper half, and the fact that the built-in jabber client
    only supports a single account. But these are all pretty minor or
    easy to work around. The only thing that really bugs me about it
    is the fact that there's no ZeroConf implementation yet for the
    platform. But there are people working on this, so it's just a
    matter of time.</p>

  <h3>Oh, and using it to Talk?</h3>

  <p>It turns out you can also use the Nexus One to interface with the
    global legacy telephone system and make calls on that. Supposedly
    it has a very nice dual-mic noise suppression system for when you
    do this, but I've only made a handful of test calls so far. I got
    a <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/plans/cell-phone-plans-detail.aspx?tp=tb1&rateplan=T-Mobile-Total-Internet-Rate-Plan">data-only
    plan</a> for half of what the regular voice+data plans go for and
    had planned to use <a href="http://sipdroid.org/">Sipdroid</a> to
    make VoIP calls with it, but then I realized I just don't make
    voice calls any more. So while there's a barely-noticeable delay
    with SIP calls over the 3G network, it really doesn't bother me. I
    also have used
    the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/android-wired-tether/">Wired
    Tether</a> app to hook up my laptop on the go and can confirm that
    calls via Skype sound fine too. So it's nice that T-Mobile isn't
    blocking that on a network level. They do seem to be the
    least-user-hostile of all the US carriers.</p>

  <p><b>Update</b>: Skype has released an Android version, which is
    now what I use for all my voice needs.</p>

  <h3>Hacking It</h3>

  <p>Of course once you get past the formalities, the question that
    matters to a hacker is how it feels to hack. I've only really
    gotten started with this, but my initial report is fairly
    positive. The official toolsets are either Eclipse or Ant, neither
    of which give me warm fuzzies, but luckily you can use Ant out of
    the box without getting exposed to the XML-editing ickiness.</p>

  <p>Getting programs onto the device is pretty simple. Once your
    source is ready, you run <kbd>ant debug</kbd>, which produces a
    .apk package. You can use the <kbd>adb</kbd> (android debugger)
    program to load it up over USB, but since I keep leaving my USB
    cable various places, I prefer just <kbd>scp</kbd>ing it to my
    server and pointing my device's browser directly at the .apk. You
    can also use this to install dev builds of various apps before
    they have been uploaded to the Market.</p>

  <p>The API seems pretty sane. Clearly a lot of thought has gone into the
    notion of supporting a single front-and-center application while
    allowing others to run in the background without impacting battery
    life and performance too severely. I've played a bit with the
    graphics tools, and they remind me a fair bit
    of <a href="http://processing.org">Processing</a>, which is a good
    thing. I haven't done much intricate UI work with a lot of buttons
    or menus, but that kind of stuff can be tedious even in the nicest
    environments.</p>

  <h3>Language of Choice</h3>

  <p>Since Dalvik (the Android VM) is based on the JVM, there's a whole host of
    languages that can run on it. Unfortunately, Dalvik is no
    Hotspot&mdash;it currently lacks JIT, and the GC is merely
    serviceable rather than astoundingly good like Hotspot's. The lack
    of a good GC makes using <a href="/132">persistent data
    structures</a> a real drag since they generate a lot of ephemeral
    garbage, so Clojure is not a good choice. The lack of JIT coupled
    with CPUs that are comparatively low-powered means that
    while <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/ruboto">JRuby
    runs</a>, it's not altogether pleasant, especially considering the
    blitz with which regular apps perform. I've been told there is
    some low-hanging fruit for improving performance on Android, so
    this is likely to improve to a degree. Rhino, Python, Lua, Scala,
    and others work, (including, I'm told, even some legacy languages
    like Java, if you can imagine that) but I decided to try the
    less-traveled route with something
    called <a href="http://github.com/headius/duby">Duby</a>.</p>

  <p><b>Update</b>: Duby has (thankfully) been renamed <a
    href="http://mirah.org">Mirah</a>.</p>

  <p>Duby is a language created by Charles Nutter, the head of the
    JRuby project. JRuby is an amazing feat in part because Ruby's
    object model is vastly different from what's natively available on
    the Java platform. By an astounding effort they've managed to put
    together a first-class Ruby implementation, but it does raise the
    question: what would a modern language look like that
    went <i>with</i> the grain of its host instead of violently
    against it? Duby is an attempt to answer that question.</p>

  <p>The syntax of Duby is nearly identical to that of Ruby; it only
    adds type declarations to method definitions. Yes, that means it's
    statically-typed. While it has type inference, it's not
    Hindley-Milner-style, it's closer to Scala's. Locals get their
    types inferred, it's only arguments in method definitions that
    need hints. So far I keep forgetting this nearly every time I
    write a new method since it looks so close to Ruby otherwise, but
    I'm sure I'll get the hang of it. Closures are compiled into
    anonymous inner classes, and you can iterate over collections with
    blocks. Duby is also unique in that it literally has no
    runtime&mdash;its literals translate directly to ArrayLists and
    HashMaps, so once you've compiled, the code is more or less
    identical to what the Java compiler would have output.</p>

  <h3>Progress</h3>

  <p>So far I've only put together a couple toy apps: Hello World, and
    a <a href="http://github.com/technomancy/Garrett">graphics demo
    with a bouncing ball</a>. Unfortunately, Duby is a <i>very</i>
    immature language, and it shows. Starting out I had to go to
    Charlie at nearly every turn with stack traces. Half the time it
    would be my fault, and half the time it would be something
    as-yet-unsupported by the compiler. But so far he's been able to
    turn around and bring in all the features I need, which has been
    quite amazing. I'm hoping to get a chance to dive into the
    compiler source myself and get to the point where I can add
    features I need with minimal guidance.</p>

  <p>Adapting the Android build process to Duby was surprisingly easy. You
    <a href="http://github.com/technomancy/Garrett/blob/master/build.xml#L67">redeclare
      the compile task</a> to call the Duby compiler instead of javac,
      tell it to output its bytecode in the right directory, and the
      rest of it just falls into place.</p>

  <p>My next plans are to add more interactivity to my graphics demo;
    I'd like to play with creating objects and applying motion rules
    to them; I hope to come up with something my two-year-old would
    get a kick out of. So far it's been a lot of fun and a great way
    to explore the capabilities of this remarkable device.</p>
