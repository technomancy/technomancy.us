  <p>The folks over at The Setup just posted
    <a href="http://phil.hagelberg.usesthis.com/">an interview</a>
    with me wherein I rant about hardware, interactivity, and
    Emacs.</p>

  <p>Note: this was written up over a month ago; if I were interviewed
    today I couldn't help but mention
    the <a href="http://nixos.org/nix">Nix</a> package manager. I use
    it on my Debian Squeeze system to complement <tt>apt-get</tt>; I
    get all the system-level stuff that has to be stable from Debian
    and anything that needs to be fresh from Nix.</p>
