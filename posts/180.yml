title: in which a spacefaring text editor holds up against an onslaught
id: 180
content: |-
  <p>I've been meaning to write about my latest
    project <a href="https://gitlab.com/technomancy/bussard">Bussard</a>
    for a while now. I describe it as a "spaceflight programming
    adventure", but it might be easier to think of it as "Emacs in
    space, but with a sci-fi novella in it", written in Lua with
    the <a href="https://love2d.org">LÖVE</a> engine. There's a lot to
    tell about the game and how I want it to eventually be a way for
    newcomers to learn programming, but I want to write here about a
    particular part of the development I had a lot of fun with.</p>

  <p>The game is played by interacting with your ship's onboard
    computer. Naturally because I wanted to give the player the
    freedom to customize the interface as much as possible, I've
    modeled it on Emacs. The game starts with your ship in orbit
    around a star and hoping to intercept an orbiting space station,
    but once you poke around a bit you realize that "flight mode" is
    only one of many modes you can activate in your onboard
    computer.</p>

  <p>Pressing <kbd>ctrl-o</kbd> allows you to open any file in the
    in-game computer, and pressing <kbd>ctrl-enter</kbd> opens a Lua
    repl buffer that uses the same editor infrastructure but lets
    you write code interactively and explore your ship's computer's
    API. Communicating with space station and planet port computers is
    done over an SSH client that also lives inside the editor. But all
    the various modes of the editor are configured
    with <a href="https://gitlab.com/technomancy/bussard/blob/master/data/src/config">Lua
    code</a> that runs in user-space; basically that code defines
    keyboard controls which simply invoke functions of your ship's
    computer to edit text[<a href="#fn1">1</a>], open SSH connections, engage the ship's
    engine, etc. Every action you can take is just a Lua function
    call.</p>

  <p>This is a fantastically flexible model for rich
    interaction&mdash;it can be completely rewritten on the fly, and
    it's seamless to experiment with new ideas you think might support
    a better way of doing things. No recompiling, no restarting, just
    flow. But another benefit of the editor API is that you can call
    it against in an automated context, such
    as <a href="https://gitlab.com/technomancy/bussard/blob/master/tests/fuzz.lua">a
      headless run</a>[<a href="#fn2">2</a>] that
    does <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing">fuzz
    tests</a>.</p>

  <p>I had to make a few changes to the API for this to work nicely,
    but in the end I realized they made the system a lot more consistent
    anyway. The fuzz testing uncovered a nice set of nasty edge-case
    editor bugs that were not too difficult to fix, but would have
    taken a lot of time to uncover with manual testing.</p>

  <p>Of course, this is pretty limited in the kinds of bugs it can
    catch&mdash;only problems that result in crashes or hangs can be
    identified by the fuzz tests. But it gives me confidence when I
    make further changes if I can throw 32768 cycles of random
    commands at it without seeing it break a sweat. And it's even
    better
    when <a href="https://gitlab.com/technomancy/bussard/pipelines">every
    incoming patch automatically has the testing applied against
    it</a> using GitLab's CI.</p>

  <p>Stay tuned for
    a <a href="https://gitlab.com/technomancy/bussard/blob/master/Changelog.md#beta-2-">second
    beta of Bussard</a> to be released very soon! There is still a lot
    more I want to do with the story line and missions, but the engine
    is getting more and more polished with each milestone. Feedback is
    very welcome, as
    are <a href="https://gitlab.com/technomancy/bussard/blob/master/Contributing.md">contributions</a>.</p>

  <p><b>Update</b>: I found that the fuzzer above has a critical flaw:
    it does not inspect the current mode's parent mode to look for
    commands there. (For instance, the console's parent mode is edit,
    and the ssh mode's parent is the console.) Fixing this immediately
    uncovered four new bugs.</p>

  <hr/>

  <p>[<a name="fn1">1</a>] Yes, I know I just set myself up for the
    old "Bussard is a great OS, it just lacks a decent text editor"
    joke. Honestly I am just waiting for someone to come along and
    implement a vim mode in-game; if any player thinks they can do
    better than the built-in editor they are welcome to try!</p>
  
  <p>[<a name="fn2">2</a>] It's a bit tricky to get LÖVE to run
    headless, but it can be done. Mostly it
    involves <a href="https://gitlab.com/technomancy/bussard/blob/master/conf.lua#L18">disabling <tt>love.graphics</tt>
    and <tt>love.window</tt> modules in <tt>conf.lua</tt></a> and
    being careful with the order of loading. You also have to
    make sure that no calls to <tt>love.graphics</tt> functions happen
    outside your <tt>love.draw</tt> function.</p>
