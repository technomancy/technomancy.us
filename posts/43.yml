content: "<p>No,  I haven't gone over to the dark side. I just happened to start using two operating systems on my machine&mdash;GNU/Linux and GNU Emacs. Now that I've switched to <a href='http://my.gnus.org'>Gnus</a> for mailing,  I basically spend all my time in Emacs and the browser. Sure,  I've got the occasional xterm up when I don't feel like using eshell (mostly for ssh),  but in general it suffices.</p>  <img src='/i/dust.jpg' alt='dusty CPU' align='right' /> <p>Anyway,  I still don't feel like I've grokked Gnus very well yet,  so I still keep Evolution open. But even if I don't end up liking Gnus a ton,  I'd rather have a great editor and a poor mailer than a great mailer and a terrible editor. Gnus is kind of... different.</p> <p>The other awesomeness I've recently discovered is <a href='http://conkeror.mozdev.org'>Conkeror</a>: </p> <blockquote>Conkeror is a mozilla based web browser designed to be completely keyboard driven,  no compromises. It also strives to behave as much like Emacs as possible. This means all the keybindings and to-die-for features of Emacs that can be imitated by a javascript/XUL web browser Just Work.</blockquote> <p>It's an extension for Firefox that recognizes that using the keyboard for everything is a much more efficient way to do things. I quote,  \"You should never have to reach for your mouse. To make sure Conkeror remains pure,  I do not own a mouse.\" That's something I can really admire! I'm still on the fence about switching from Epiphany,  but it's really intriguing. What I'd really like is <tt>gecko-mode</tt> for Emacs,  but I understand that the rendering engine is pretty primitive.</p> <p>Oh yeah,  and here's a photo of my desktop's heatsink. Compressed air is your friend.</p>"
