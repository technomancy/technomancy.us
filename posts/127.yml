  <p>This week I had the good fortune to be in San Francisco
    for <a href='http://www.meetup.com/The-Bay-Area-Clojure-User-Group/calendar/10417495/'>a
    meeting of the Bay Area Clojure Meetup</a>. This meeting was a
    special event since Clojure's creator, Rich Hickey, was in town
    for the big JavaOne conference. We ended up packing out the room
    with sixty people, which made it probably the largest gathering of
    Clojure programmers ever.</p>

  <p>The meeting began with a handful of so-called "lightning talks"
    (of various lengths) on all sorts of topics. A few highlights were
    Amit
    Rathore's <a href='http://s-expressions.com/2009/05/02/startup-logbook-distributed-clojure-system-in-production-v02/'>Swarmiji</a>
    clustering library and George Jahad's talk
    on <a href='http://georgejahad.com/clojure/cljdb.html'>decompiling
    Clojure with jdb</a>, which showed tools to get a new perspective
    on how your code gets compiled.</p>

  <p>After these Rich gave a talk on the recent work he's been doing
    on chunked sequences. Basically when a seq wraps a vector or
    vector-like collection, rather than every first/rest invocation
    breaking the vector down piece by piece, the seq can break a chunk
    of the vector off to work on all at once and keep its own internal
    counter that points to the current position in the chunk. The
    motivation here was that while you generally can rely on the seq
    abstraction to map over each element in a vector in a functional
    manner, sometimes performance concerns force you to use a more
    imperative-style loop instead. With the chunking in place, the map
    approach is even more performant than the less-idiomatic loop, so
    there's one fewer reason to stray from the functional
    approach. It's really encouraging to see that Rich is making this
    a priority&mdash;he wants to make sure that you never get
    penalized for doing things the elegant way.</p>

  <p>After this Rich hosted a Q&amp;A session, from which two main
    points stuck in my mind. He mentioned that before the 1.0 release,
    he <a href='http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/2ee2b28e9dd3516b/b09cdc226c95383a'>asked
    what people thought would be a good set of short-term goals for
    the project</a>, to which the response was overwhelmingly "move
    off SVN to git". Since the project was still fresh of a jump from
    SourceForge to Google Code, he was reluctant at first, but he
    seems to have been convinced that the distributed approach is
    what's best for the community. He promised us that the move will
    happen. He's
    currently <a href='http://github.com/richhickey'>experimenting
    with GitHub</a> and making sure for himself that tool support is
    good enough.</p>

  <p>The other question of particular interest
    was <a href='http://blog.objectmentor.com/articles/2009/06/05/rich-hickey-on-testing'>that
    of tests</a>. Rich doesn't write tests for Clojure. The community
    has contributed a test suite, but it's kept in a separate
    repository and doesn't offer full coverage. Rich's opinion is that
    tests are for finding bugs, and that he is able to avoid bugs by
    reasoning out the problem up front, so it's not a wise use of his
    time for him to write his own tests, though he does appreciate and
    run the community-provided suite. This made me very nervous at
    first, but the next day I read
    <a href='http://web.mac.com/ben_moseley/frp/paper-v1_01.pdf'>Out
      of the Tarpit</a> [PDF], a paper he recommended at the meeting.
      The paper makes a strong case for informal reasoning being a
      suitable substitute for test cases in codebases that exhibit
      referential transparency. While I still prefer TDD for its help
      in the design phase of coding, I'm much more ready to accept the
      notion that thinking through the problem up front and verifying
      it with manual tests is actually a feasible approach to getting
      working code in functional languages, though of course in
      situations where mutability is the norm it leads to disastrous
      results.</p>
