  <p>There are a number of ways to solve the problem of distributing
    prerelease gems in Ruby. Indicating a version is a prerelease in
    the documentation alone won't cut it; it's bound to sneak on to a
    production system and be forgotten about. Some projects simply
    don't bump the version until it's final, but this means if you try
    out a prerelease version it will replace an existing stable one,
    which is bad news. Up until recently, Rails marked them by
    counting backwards from the target, so the prerelease for 2.1.0
    was 2.0.999. This ends up being better, but it still breaks when
    another gem says it depends on any version of Rails in the 2.0
    series since 2.0.999 should be in the 2.1 series and introduces
    changes that will break gems expecting 2.0. Now Rails has changed
    strategies, saying that 2.1.0 is actually a prerelease, and that
    the first stable version would be 2.1.1. This is safer in terms of
    dependencies, but much more confusing to users; they expect 2.1.0
    to be the actual release.</p>

  <p>So during RubyConf, I worked
    with <a href='http://alexvollmer.com'>Alex Vollmer</a>
    and <a href='http://blog.hasmanythrough.com'>Josh Susser</a> to
    <a href='/117'>fix the problem from within RubyGems</a>. The idea
    was that you should be able to mark a given version as a
    prerelease, and it wouldn't be downloaded unless someone
    specifically asked to include prereleases. This way in-development
    gems can get served without projects needing to run their own gem
    servers or rely on github; everything can be done through
    RubyForge. It also has the advantage of being much more clear;
    there's no need for each project to have their own policy on the
    matter. I've finally finished committing the new functionality to
    RubyGems trunk, so if you're interested in creating a prerelease
    gem, I'd encourage you to grab a copy of trunk and try it out:</p>

  <p><tt>$ svn co svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/rubygems/trunk rubygems</tt></p>
  <p><tt>$ cd rubygems && sudo ruby setup.rb</tt></p>

  <p>Once it's installed, try releasing a gem (using hoe or whatever)
    with a version with a segment that contains letters, and it will
    be considered prerelease. 2.2.0.rc1 or 1.6.5.a would work. The
    numeric segments are sorted as you'd expect, and the alphanumeric
    segments are sorted with String#sort, but prereleases always sort
    lower than releases within a version series. So 2.2.0 would be
    higher than 2.2.0.rc1 though they'd both be in the 2.2
    series. This should ease a lot of confusion in this area. As
    always, if you run into any problems,
    please <a href='http://rubyforge.org/tracker/?atid=575&group_id=126&func=browse'>report
    them on the tracker</a> since a 1.3.2 release is not far away.</p>

  <p>In other news, it appears that you should be very careful when
    you <a href='http://twitter.com/technomancy/statuses/1313409184'>complain
    about how software isn't being maintained</a>. I had been keeping
    my own fork
    of <a href='http://github.com/technomancy/gitjour'>Gitjour</a>,
    which is a tool for sharing repositories over local networks when
    either your Internet connection is unreliable (like at tech
    conferences) or when you can't be bothered to host a repo
    somewhere. My fork allowed gitjour to work with Avahi and had a
    few other tweaks and had never made it back upstream, but it
    seemed like there was a lot of uncoordinated development on them
    across github forks as well.</p>

  <p>Somehow my call for the maintainers to step up got turned around
    into me <i>becoming</i> the maintainer. Not exactly what I had
    expected, but I was happy to be able to help out. I ended up
    pushing out my fixes in a release as well as pulling in
    some <a href='http://github.com/alexvollmer/gitjour/commit/bd843d2aaeae4a5b721dbefd3725d5868645903c'>nice
    web-related stuff from Alex</a>. <tt>gitjour web</tt> will now
    throw up
    an <a href='http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-instaweb.html'>instaweb</a>
    instance, and <tt>gitjour browse</tt> will let you look through
    all the instawebs being advertised locally. So if you're headed to
    a conference at which you plan to hack any time soon, be sure to
    not leave home without a copy of gitjour. You know the <tt>sudo
    gem install</tt> drill.</p>

  <p>Finally, there's been a recent turn of events that's left me
    without work for the present. As I've hopefully made obvious, I've
    got a pretty decent portfolio of free software contributions, but if
    you're not convinced,
    visiting <a href='/projects'>http://technomancy.us/projects</a>
    should do the trick. My <a href='/resume'>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</a>
    may also be of interest. Thanks for reading.</p>
