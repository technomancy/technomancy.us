  <p>Since joining <a href='http://sonian.net'>Sonian</a> in April,
    I've been part of a distributed team that has grown to four
    Clojure programmers all living in different states of the
    US. While it's been great to be able to draw from a wide pool of
    talent, working with a distributed team has its challenges.  While
    we had
    everyone <a href='http://www.flickr.com/photos/technomancy/tags/sonian/'>in
    Seattle</a> for a week we got to do lot of pair programming, but
    after everyone went back home we were left wondering how we could
    emulate that over-the-shoulder atmosphere without all being
    physically in one place.</p>

  <p>We tried VNC, but it was simply too laggy. Then we tried
    <a href='http://haruska.com/2009/09/29/remote-pair-programming/'>shared
      screen sessions</a>. This worked out pretty well. The defining
      characteristic here is that both participants see exactly the
      same thing. Only one can edit at a time, which is usually not a
      big deal when you're pairing. Since it's shared on a per-session
      basis rather than a per-document basis, it means you can share
      things like the woefully under-appreciated <kbd>M-x
      erevision</kbd> feature, which is fantastic for code
      reviews. But it still feels a bit restrictive and out of the
      regular groove.</p>

  <p>Then I discovered <a href='http://rudel.sf.net'>Rudel</a>, an
    Emacs client for the <a href='http://gobby.0x539.de/trac/'>Obby
    protocol</a>. Years ago I'd started <a href='/45'>my own
    implementation of this called Ebby</a>, but I wasn't aware of the
    more nuanced implications of the protocol, so my implementation
    was never very robust. Rudel, on the other hand, does a great job
    of allowing us to share documents among collaborators in
    real-time.</p>

  <p>Now we use Rudel for our main solution and then fall back to
    screen whenever we want to do something that involves
    synchronizing the whole screen. While you can run shell or SLIME
    sessions in Rudel, it's a bit awkward since only the original
    publisher of the document can actually interact with the
    subprocess. The other person can enter commands, but they can't
    run them, since pressing <kbd>enter</kbd> will simply insert a
    newline. I have been playing with the idea of using the Obby chat
    functionality as a side-channel to perform these kinds of things,
    but I haven't written any code for it yet.</p>

  <p>One thing you've really got to be careful with in this situation
    is communicating who's responsible for committing. Otherwise you
    could easily get conflicting commits. SIP works great for talking
    through this vocally, though unfortunately mostly at work we're
    using Skype, which has a wretchedly bad client for GNU/Linux.</p>

  <p>Of course, this is only feasible if everyone on the team can work
    in an environment that's obby-aware. Gobby, the reference
    implementation, is a pretty weak editor for coding, and Rudel
    seems to be the only other existing implementation. So if an
    intrepid Vim user came along who could implement an Obby client in
    Vimscript, he might be able to consider him, but for now we're an
    all-Emacs team.</p>

  <p>I'm working with Jan, the Rudel author, towards an 0.2 release
    which should improve stability pretty significantly. At that point
    I should be able to bundle it up for ELPA, though if you're
    running an Emacs that's older than October 2009 you will need to
    install the <a href='http://cedet.sf.net'>CEDET</a> library by
    hand.</p>

  <p>Anyway, if you work on a distributed team, you should give it a shot.</p>
