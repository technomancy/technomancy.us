  <p>Earlier this month
    I <a href="http://lein-survey.herokuapp.com/results">published the
    results</a> of a survey I had posted for Leiningen users. I got a
    lot of great data, but I especially appreciated the free-form
    "other comments" section that let people just ramble. I was happy
    to see that many of the suggestions have already been implemented
    in the ongoing work on Leiningen 2.</p>

  <blockquote>I still think lein-multi should be rolled into core so
    people can be encouraged to test cross-version.</blockquote>

  <h4>Profiles</h4>

  <p>This brings me to what is probably the biggest feature in
    Leiningen 2.0: profiles. In Leiningen 1 we had some special
    cases to segregate out "dev" mode from the rest so you would only
    have certain dependencies or directories available during
    development. This is useful to have, but the implementation was
    pretty ad-hoc and riddled with special cases. During
    some <a href="/155">discussion with the Cake developers</a> we
    talked about whether that could be generalized, which turned into
    the idea of profiles.</p>

  <p>So now rather than a handful of project configuration keys that
    are only active during development time, we have a <tt>:dev</tt>
    profile that's active by default where you can keep your
    additional test-only <tt>:dependencies</tt>
    and <tt>:resource-paths</tt>. You can also keep all
    your <tt>:plugins</tt> that you want active across all projects in
    the <tt>:user</tt> profile rather than using <kbd>lein plugin
    install</kbd>. That way there is only ever one plugin list active
    at a time, meaning it can be de-duplicated, avoiding messy conflicts.</p>

  <p>But you can also create profiles for other situations:</p>

  <pre class="code"><span class="esk-paren">(</span>defproject clj-http <span class="string">"0.3.3-SNAPSHOT"</span>
    <span class="constant">:description</span> <span class="string">"A Clojure HTTP library"</span>
    <span class="constant">:url</span> <span class="string">"https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http/"</span>
    <span class="constant">:min-lein-version</span> <span class="string">"2.0.0"</span>
    <span class="constant">:dependencies</span> [[org.clojure/clojure <span class="string">"1.3.0"</span>] <span class="comment-delimiter">; </span><span class="comment">elided below...
  </span>                 [org.apache.httpcomponents/httpclient <span class="string">"4.1.2"</span>]
                   [cheshire <span class="string">"2.2.0"</span>]]
    <span class="constant">:profiles</span> {<span class="constant">:dev</span> {<span class="constant">:dependencies</span> [[ring/ring-jetty-adapter <span class="string">"1.0.2"</span>]
                                    [ring/ring-devel <span class="string">"1.0.2"</span>]]}
               <span class="constant">:1.2</span> {<span class="constant">:dependencies</span> [[org.clojure/clojure <span class="string">"1.2.1"</span>]]}
               <span class="constant">:1.4</span> {<span class="constant">:dependencies</span> [[org.clojure/clojure <span class="string">"1.4.0-beta1"</span>]]}}
    <span class="constant">:aliases</span> {<span class="string">"all"</span> [<span class="string">"with-profile"</span> <span class="string">"dev,1.2:dev:dev,1.4"</span>]}<span class="esk-paren">)</span></pre>

  <p>Here you can see the <tt>:dev</tt> profile with some handy
    dependencies used for testing, but there are also profiles
    for <tt>:1.2</tt> and <tt>:1.4</tt> that can be used like lein
    multi. The <tt>with-profile</tt> task is used to apply alternate
    profiles to a given task run:</p>

  <pre>$ lein with-profile dev,1.2 test
  Performing task 'test' with profile(s): 'dev,1.2'

  Testing clj-http.test.client

  Testing clj-http.test.cookies

  Testing clj-http.test.core

  Ran 47 tests containing 175 assertions.
  0 failures, 0 errors.</pre>

  <p>You can see that commas allow multiple profiles to be specified
    at once. You can also use colons to chain together profile sets
    sequentially:</p>

  <pre>$ lein with-profile dev:dev,1.2:dev,1.4 test
  Performing task 'test' with profile(s): 'dev'
  [...]
  Performing task 'test' with profile(s): 'dev,1.2'
  [...]
  Performing task 'test' with profile(s): 'dev,1.4'
  [...]</pre>

  <p>Of course, since <tt>with-profile</tt> is a higher-order task, it
    can accept any other task as an argument, not just <tt>test</tt>.
    So you could use it for deploying to different environments or
    any place where you'd want an alternate set of project
    configuration values.</p>

  <h4>Aliases</h4>

  <p>You'll also notice that the <tt>:aliases</tt> entry in the
    <tt>defproject</tt> above maps a string to a vector. This is a new
    feature about which I am unreasonably pleased. You've always been
    able to add aliases for Leiningen tasks; this is how <kbd>lein
    halp</kbd> has worked. But now you can actually alias a string to
    a partial application of a task:</p>

  <pre class="code"><span class="constant">:aliases</span> {<span class="string">"all"</span> [<span class="string">"with-profile"</span> <span class="string">"dev,1.2:dev:dev,1.4"</span>]}</pre>

  <p>This means that <kbd>all test</kbd> translates into
    calling <kbd>with-profile dev,1.2:dev:dev,1.4 test</kbd>. But
    partially-applied aliases have other uses as well:</p>

  <pre class="code"><span class="constant">:aliases</span> {<span class="string">"reflect"</span> [<span class="string">"assoc"</span> <span class="string">":warn-on-reflection"</span> <span class="string">"true"</span> <span class="string">"compile"</span>]}</pre>

  <p>This allows you to invoke <kbd>lein reflect</kbd> to get a list
    of all your reflection warnings. Note that in this
    case <kbd>assoc</kbd> refers to the task that comes from
    the <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/lein-assoc">lein-assoc</a>
    plugin, not the <kbd>clojure.core/assoc</kbd> function. Each
    string in the alias vector is interpreted the same way as if it
    were a direct command-line argument to the <kbd>lein</kbd> script,
    which is why strings must be used. In this case reading it into
    keywords and booleans happens inside the <kbd>assoc</kbd>
    task.</p>

  <p>And that's one of the neat things about having tasks as functions.</p>

  <h4>Repl</h4>

  <p>The <kbd>repl</kbd> task has been rewritten from the ground-up by
    Colin Jones. The new version supports a JVM-native readline
    implementation as well as thorough completion and nREPL support.</p>

  <h4>Preview</h4>

  <p>By this point I'm sure you're thinking to yourself, "Gosh, that
    sounds super; I wish I could use it now!" In fact, Leiningen 2 is
    already pretty usable and stable if you don't mind running from
    git. You need a copy of Leiningen 1.x around to bootstrap it, but
    running <kbd>lein install</kbd> inside the <tt>leiningen-core</tt>
    directory should get you to the point where you can
    symlink <tt>bin/lein</tt> to somewhere on your path and have it
    work. I recommend linking it as <tt>lein2</tt> for the time being
    since you'll probably still need an installation of 1.x easily
    accessible.</p>

  <p>Of course, being a major version increment it's got some
    backwards-incompatibilities. Fresh from witnessing the very bumpy
    transition to Clojure 1.3, I'd rather avoid that for Leiningen 2,
    so taking a cue from golang's <tt>gofix</tt> tool, I've
    released the <tt>lein-precate</tt> plugin.</p>

  <p>Precate, obviously, is the opposite of deprecate. The idea is
    that you could run it on your project and have it spit out a new
    <tt>project.clj</tt> which would be compatible with Leiningen 2.
    It's not perfect, but it should provide you with a starting point
    for your transition:</p>

  <pre>$ lein plugin install lein-precate 0.3.0
  $ cat project.clj # the original 1.x-compatible version:
  (defproject clojure-http-client "1.1.1-SNAPSHOT"
    :description "An HTTP client for Clojure."
    :source-path "src/clj"
    :extra-classpath-dirs ["dumb-stuff"]
    :dev-dependencies [[swank-clojure "1.3.4"]]
    :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.2.1"]
                   [org.clojure/clojure-contrib "1.2.0"]])

  $ lein precate # let's see how that would look for Leiningen 2
  (defproject clojure-http-client "1.1.1-SNAPSHOT"
    :description "An HTTP client for Clojure."
    :source-paths ["src/clj"]
    :dependencies {org.clojure/clojure "1.2.1", 
                   org.clojure/clojure-contrib "1.2.0"}
    :profiles {:dev
                {:resource-paths ["dumb-stuff"],
                 :dependencies {swank-clojure "1.3.4"}}}
    :min-lein-version "2.0.0")</pre>

  <p>Unfortunately that output had to be manually edited a bit for cosmetic
    reasons; Clojure's pretty-printer doesn't really know what to do
    with <code>defproject</code> forms. But it should cover most of
    the changes necessary to take your project into the exciting new
    world of Leiningen 2. The biggest changes will come from the move
    from <tt>:dev-dependencies</tt> to <tt>:dependencies</tt> in
    the <tt>:dev</tt> profile. But this is not a foolproof translation
    since in Leiningen 2 <tt>:dependencies</tt> only run in the
    context of the project itself, while in Leiningen
    1 <tt>:dev-dependencies</tt> ran in both Leiningen and the
    project. In retrospect this was a design mistake, but there are a
    number of plugins out there that take advantage of this fact and
    will need to be split into separate artifacts for the parts that
    run in Leiningen vs the parts that run in the project. I've taken
    some time to adapt some of the most commonly-used plugins for this
    change, but I'm sure I missed some of the more obscure ones.</p>

  <p>The plan from here is to polish off a few more features and cut a
    preview release. The preview will still be missing a handful of
    the more obscure features from Leiningen 1 like shell wrappers and
    selective transitive class file cleaning, but for the vast
    majority of projects it should be usable for everyday work. See
    the "post-preview" section
    of <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/blob/master/todo.org">the
    todo file</a> for details on what's remaining. The hope is to have
    it ready at latest by
    the <a href="http://clojurewest.org/">Clojure/West
    conference</a>. Enjoy!</p>
