  <p>So this post is ridiculously self-indulgent; you've been
    warned. I've mostly written it out here for my future self to look
    back on in a mix of amusement and embarassment. It's just a
    write-up of the tools I use daily in the style
    of <a href="http://usesthis.com/">the interviews at
    usesthis.com</a>.</p>

  <h4>What hardware do you use?</h4>

  <p>I use a Thinkpad X200s primarily. It's hard to find a machine
    that's acceptably light (2.4 lbs/1.1 kg) but still has a decent
    resolution; most "small" laptops these days have a vertical
    resolution no greater than my phone, which would be embarrassing for
    me to use. The Thinkpad has the best keyboard of any laptop; I
    appreciate the crisp response. It also has an integrated trackpoint,
    which is nice in that you can move the pointer without taking your
    hands off the home row, but I try to avoid it as much as
    possible. I'm much more productive when using 100% keyboard
    commands. Sometimes I'll just pluck the trackpoint out entirely just
    to make sure I'm not using it without thinking.</p>

  <p>I work from coffee shops frequently since I have a remote job,
    but when I'm
    in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/technomancy/tags/laboratory/">my
    code lab</a> I use a standing desk with an external 23-inch
    monitor. I rotate the monitor to portrait orientation when I'm not
    remote pairing
    with <a href="http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">tmux</a>. I have a
    recliner next to the desk onto which I fall back to for a couple
    hours out of the day. While I'm standing I wear what has been
    affectionately
    termed <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/technomancy/4397554484/">"keyboard
    pants"</a>. It's a Kinesis Freestyle with kneepads attached. The
    kneepads are worn significantly above the knee&mdash;the idea is
    to allow myself to type in as neutral of a position as
    possible. My arms are relaxed in a downward position, and my
    wrists are totally straight. It takes some getting used to, but
    from an RSI perspective it's quite beneficial. It also just feels
    great not to be sitting all day.</p>

  <p>I keep a Nexus One phone in my pocket. As far as I know it's the
    only major phone currently available that's designed to be
    rootable by the end user, and hence the only phone I am
    comfortable purchasing. As a nice bonus it also happens to
    be <a href="http://technomancy.us/134">one of the best phones
    available</a>, though it seems absurd to call it a phone. I hardly
    make any actual voice calls on it, though when I do it's VOIP
    calling through <a href="http://sipdroid.org/">Sipdroid</a>. I
    have <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.com/">CyanogenMod</a>
    installed, which has a really nice auto-tether over USB.</p>

  <h4>And what about software?</h4>

  <p>I start with a boring old Ubuntu GNOME install. To my
    embarrassment I actually even use metacity, the default window
    manager. My secret sauce is
    <a href="http://burtonini.com/blog/computers/devilspie/">devilspie</a>,
    which is a rules engine for window placement and behaviour. I
    <a href="http://github.com/technomancy/dotfiles/blob/master/.devilspie/max.ds">fullscreen
    and undecorate all my commonly-used programs</a> and have certain
    programs only show up on a given virtual desktop. It's flexible enough
    to trick people into thinking I use <a href="http://xmonad.org/">a real
    WM</a>. My other main desktop-level customization
    is <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/xbindkeys/xbindkeys.html">xbindkeys</a>,
    a little app that embeds a Scheme interpreter to configure
    bindings. This is nice because it decouples them from the window
    manager. The only part of GNOME I use on a regular basis is the
    panel. I like having CPU/network/memory graphs available so I can tell
    when my machine is hard at work. The panel wifi tool is pretty handy
    too.</p>

  <p>Apart from that it's Emacs, Emacs, and Emacs. I am mostly able to
    maintain the illusion that Emacs is the only program I actually
    interact with regularly. I generally have four or five instances
    running at once which is uncommon; most Emacs users keep single
    instances with uptimes in the weeks range. I use this as a
    namespacing technique to keep real work separated from
    play/chat/mail. My staple modes
    are <a href="http://alexvollmer.com/posts/2009/01/18/meet-magit/">magit</a>, <a href="http://github.com/technomancy/clojure-mode">clojure-mode</a>, <a href="http://common-lisp.net/project/slime/">slime</a>,
    <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ParEdit">paredit</a>, <a href="http://orgmode.org/">org-mode</a>,
    and <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ERC">erc</a>. I used
    to waver
    between <a href="http://emacs-jabber.sourceforge.net/">jabber.el</a>
    or <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ELIM">elim</a> and
    leaving the embrace of Emacs for something like Pidgin, which was
    not pleasant at all. But now I'm pretty settled
    on <a href="http://www.bitlbee.org/main.php/news.r.html">bitlbee</a>,
    which allows you to connect to your IM accounts via an IRC
    client.</p>

  <p>I have all my Emacs config (accumulated over years of obsessive
    tweaking) bundled up as
    the <a href="http://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit">Emacs
    Starter Kit</a>. Lots of other developers use this as a base off
    which to build or just to steal ideas from, which I love. (It's a
    little funny to get bug reports for your own dotfiles.) I try to
    save all my other config in git as well in order to make it easy
    for me to get up and running quickly on a new machine.</p>

  <p>The other key to maintaining the Emacs-all-the-time illusion
    is <a href="http://conkeror.org">Conkeror</a>. Emacs doesn't have
    a modern web browser in it yet, so this is an attempt to trick
    Mozilla Xulrunner into thinking it's Emacs. Apart from being
    implemented in JS instead of lisp, it's a very good
    approximation. The buffer switcher features completion that's far
    better than anything I've used in a mainstream browser, and its
    mouseless browsing support is excellent. It's also very stable as
    long as you don't have any garbage plugins like Adobe Flash
    installed. Its only flaw is being based on Gecko rather than
    Webkit. I've experimented a bit with mouseless extensions for
    Chromium, but the extension mechanism in that browser is crippled
    in comparison to what's possible in Mozilla, so while the speed
    boost was nice, this ended up being very frustrating in
    practice.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately I need to use skype for work. While I've been
    pretty impressed with its ability to use a very limited amount of
    bandwidth, it's quite unstable, and its UI is very awkward. Since
    it's not free software there's very little hope of this improving
    soon. The one thing that eases this pain is the skype plugin
    for <a href="http://do.davebsd.com/">gnome-do</a>. It allows calls
    to be initiated from the keyboard. While I am a fan of the ideas
    behind gnome-do, this is the only thing I use it for since in
    general Emacs does a better job at the kinds of things it
    does.</p>

  <h4>What would your dream setup be?</h4>

  <p>I really wish I could buy a modern laptop with a 4:3 aspect
    ratio. I find the loss of vertical space in widescreens very
    annoying for anything other than watching movies. Apart from that
    the Thinkpad X200s is nearly everything I want in a laptop. In a
    perfect world I would have a battery with the weight of a 4-cell
    and the capacity of a 9-cell. Half the weight of my laptop is the
    battery.</p>

  <p>I recently switched to using gmail in the browser, and while it's
    decent for everyday mail it is markedly inferior to gnus for mailing
    lists. I'm only using it because it syncs with my phone, and setting up
    offlineimap to work with gnus and gmail sounds like a lot of work. This
    is definitely the least-satisfying part of an all-Emacs setup, at least
    if you want to read mail on a mobile device.</p>

  <p>I imagine if they ever get
    the <a href="http://senseboard.com">senseboard</a> working it will
    be a pretty sweet innovation. I could also use a HUD for my phone
    for when I'm in the car. Or possibly on my sunglasses for when I'm
    just walking around; you know... I'm not picky.</p>
