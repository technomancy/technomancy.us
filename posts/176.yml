  <p><a href="/173">Earlier this year</a> I designed and built a small
    ergonomic mechanical keyboard.  My original goal was just that of
    personal use; I wanted to take the joy of mechanical keyboards
    with me when I go work from coffee shops.
    I <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/atreus">put the design
    on Github</a> and documented my build process with photos, and
    once I finished my own keyboard I figured I'd be done with it.
    But a few of my friends were intrigued and asked me if I'd build
    them keyboards.  I had a lot of fun constructing my first one, so
    I agreed to build a few more to sell to friends.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once I got going, one thing led to another, and I started getting
    queries from friends-of-friends.  I put
    up <a href="http://atreus.technomancy.us">a web site
    with an order form</a>, and orders started trickling in.  Due to
    the hand-wiring approach used the construction of these boards
    took a good four hours of nights and weekends, so a backlog
    started piling up.  At this point I decided I could make myself
    less of a bottleneck by selling kits and allowing interested
    customers to do the assembly themselves.  This was a big help, and
    it seemed people really liked the hands-on approach.  There's
    nothing quite like the satisfaction of using hardware you've
    constructed yourself.

  <p>The "proper" way to make a keyboard is to build it around a
    circuit board. But circuit board design is its own skill, and
    their production benefits greatly from volume discounts, so it
    really didn't make sense for my own personal project.  But once I
    started to get more orders it became clear that a circuit board
    would help a lot since the process of hand-wiring is rather
    intimidating if you've never done any soldering before. I broke
    out <a href="">KiCAD</a> and started laying out a circuit board to
    hold the switches, diodes, and microcontroller after reading
    through some documentation and tutorials.
  </p>

  <p>I carefully laid out one side of the circuit board according to
    the row spacing and staggering used in the laser-cut case files without too
    much trouble. Each switch was connected to the others in the row
    with one pin and to the others in the column with the other, and
    each row and column was brought back in to the middle with the
    microcontroller. Then I hit a snag&mdash;the two halves of the
    Atreus keyboard are rotated inward at a 10Â° angle, but when I went
    to rotate the design in KiCAD rather than rotating them as a unit,
    it simply applied the rotation to each component individually.</p>

  <p>At that point I was starting to think I'd have to do all this
    trig by hand and enter the calculated coordinates one by one into
    KiCAD's edit boxes, which did not sound like fun. I asked on the
    Freenode channel and found to my delight that the new file format
    for KiCAD is based on s-expressions! It can all be easily
    manipulated programmatically. Since the data includes symbols with
    leading digits in their names, the Clojure reader couldn't handle
    it, but Racket didn't have a problem with it. So I put
    together <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/atreus/blob/master/atreus.rkt#L157">some
    Racket code</a> to run the trig necessary to calculate the switch
    and diode positions.

  <p>Anyway, I just finished assembling my first circuit-board-based
    keyboard, and it works nicely. It's dramatically easier than the
    hand-wired variant, even such that my six-year-old son wants to
    build his own. I had to make one change to give clearance for the
    micro-USB connector, but I was able to apply this "revision" to my
    already-produced circuit boards with a hacksaw.</p>

  <p>Up to this point I haven't publically promoted it much, but
    now that the circuit board is here I'm prepared to handle a
    greater volume of orders. So if you're interested in building your
    own mechanical travel keyboard or want to hack some hardware
    designed using Lisp, take a look
