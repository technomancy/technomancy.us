title: in which preconceptions are unavoidable
id: 175
content: |-
  <p>In my <a href="/174">last post</a> I introduced my latest
    project, <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/cooper">a
    HyperCard clone</a> I've been writing in
    the <a href="http://racket-lang.org">Racket programming
    language</a>, which is a practical and accessible dialect of
    Scheme. I'd played around a bit with Racket before, but this was
    the first time I'd used it for anything nontrivial. Any
    time <a href="http://www.greghendershott.com/2014/10/hands-on-with-clojure.html">you
    come to an unfamiliar language</a>, there's naturally a period of
    disorientation in which it can be frustrating to find your
    footing. Racket's similarity to Clojure (the language I'm
    currently most proficient in) means this shouldn't be as
    pronounced as it would be with many languages, but these are my
    subjective reactions to how it's gone implementing my first
    project. There are a number of gripes, but if I may offer a
    spoiler, in the end Racket provides satisfactory ways of addressing all of
    them in ways that aren't obvious up-front as well as bringing
    valuable new perspectives to the table.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>When I was getting started with Racket, I was pleased to see that
    it defaults to immutable data structures. Coming from a Clojure
    background, I'm used to using free-form maps for
    everything. Racket has hash tables which sound similar, so let's
    take a look at how they're used:</p>

  <pre class="code"><span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="keyword">define</span> <span class="variable-name">h</span> #hash<span class="racket-paren">((</span><span class="racket-selfeval">'a</span> . <span class="racket-selfeval">123</span><span class="racket-paren">)</span>
                  <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="racket-selfeval">'b</span> . <span class="racket-selfeval">234</span><span class="racket-paren">)</span>
                  <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="racket-selfeval">'c</span> . <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="builtin">+</span> <span class="racket-selfeval">345</span> <span class="racket-selfeval">456</span><span class="racket-paren">))))</span>

  <span class="racket-paren">(</span>h <span class="racket-selfeval">'b</span><span class="racket-paren">)</span>
  <span class="comment-delimiter">; </span><span class="comment">application: not a procedure;
  </span><span class="comment-delimiter">;  </span><span class="comment">expected a procedure that can be applied to arguments
  </span><span class="comment-delimiter">;   </span><span class="comment">given: '#hash((a . 123) (b . 234) (c . (+ 345 456)))
  </span><span class="comment-delimiter">;   </span><span class="comment">arguments...:
  </span><span class="comment-delimiter">;    </span><span class="comment">'b</span></pre>

  <p>What's going on here? Well, it looks like hash tables can't be
    called like functions. This has never made any sense to me, since
    immutable hash tables are actually <i>more</i> like mathematical
    functions than lambdas are. But whatever, we'll just
    use <tt>hash-ref</tt> instead; it's more verbose but should get
    the job done:</p>

  <pre class="code"><span class="racket-paren">(</span>hash-ref h <span class="racket-selfeval">'b</span><span class="racket-paren">)</span>

  <span class="comment-delimiter">; </span><span class="comment">hash-ref: no value found for key
  </span><span class="comment-delimiter">;   </span><span class="comment">key: 'b
  </span></pre>

  <p>It turns out Racket implicitly quotes everything inside the hash
    table. So OK, maybe that's a little nicer since you don't need to
    quote the symbol keys in the hash table:</p>

  <pre class="code"><span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="keyword">define</span> <span class="variable-name">h</span> #hash<span class="racket-paren">((</span>a . <span class="racket-selfeval">123</span><span class="racket-paren">)</span>
                  <span class="racket-paren">(</span>b . <span class="racket-selfeval">234</span><span class="racket-paren">)</span>
                  <span class="racket-paren">(</span>c . <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="builtin">+</span> <span class="racket-selfeval">345</span> <span class="racket-selfeval">456</span><span class="racket-paren">))))</span>

  <span class="racket-paren">(</span>hash-ref h <span class="racket-selfeval">'b</span><span class="racket-paren">)</span> <span class="comment-delimiter">; </span><span class="comment">-&gt; 234
  </span><span class="racket-paren">(</span>hash-ref h <span class="racket-selfeval">'c</span><span class="racket-paren">)</span> <span class="comment-delimiter">; </span><span class="comment">-&gt; '(+ 345 456)</span></pre>

  <p>Oh dear... that's less than ideal, especially compared to Clojure's
    simple <tt>(def h {:a 123 :b 234 :c (+ 345 456)}</tt> and <tt>(:c
    h)</tt> notation. But let's move on[<a href="#fn1">1</a>] since it
    turns out hash tables are not nearly as important as maps are in
    Clojure. It's more idiomatic to use structs if your fields are
    known up-front:</p>

  <pre class="code"><span class="racket-paren">(</span>struct abc <span class="racket-paren">(</span>a b c<span class="racket-paren">))</span>
  <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="keyword">define</span> <span class="variable-name">s</span> <span class="racket-paren">(</span>abc <span class="racket-selfeval">123</span> <span class="racket-selfeval">234</span> <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="builtin">+</span> <span class="racket-selfeval">345</span> <span class="racket-selfeval">456</span><span class="racket-paren">)))</span>

  <span class="racket-paren">(</span>abc-c s<span class="racket-paren">)</span> <span class="comment-delimiter">; </span><span class="comment">-&gt; 801
  </span>s <span class="comment-delimiter">; </span><span class="comment">-&gt; #&lt;abc&gt;
  </span></pre>

  <p>So that's nice in that it avoids the implicit quoting; our
    regular evaluation rules work at least. But what's this at the
    end? Racket structs default to being opaque. This may have made
    sense years ago when you needed to protect your mutable fields,
    but now that immutability is the default, it just gets in the
    way. Luckily you can set the <tt>#:transparent</tt> option when
    defining structs, and this will likely become the default in the
    future.</p>

  <p>One place where Racket has a clear advantage is that you'll never
    get nil back from an accessor. Both in hash tables and structs, if
    a field doesn't exist, you'll get an error immediately rather than
    allowing bogus data to percolate through your call chain and blow
    up in an unrelated place. (Though of course with hash tables you
    can specify your own value for the not found case.)  In any case,
    less "garbage in, garbage out" is a welcome change for me as a
    human who frequently makes mistakes.</p>

  <p>What about updates though? Mutable struct fields have setter
    functions auto-generated, but inexplicably the nondestructive
    equivalents for immutable fields are missing. Instead
    the <tt>struct-copy</tt> macro is recommended. Here we change
    the <tt>b</tt> field of an <tt>abc</tt> struct instance we've
    defined:</p>

  <pre class="code"><span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="keyword">define</span> <span class="variable-name">s2</span> <span class="racket-paren">(</span>struct-copy abc s <span class="racket-paren">[</span>b <span class="racket-selfeval">987</span><span class="racket-paren">]))</span>
  <span class="racket-paren">(</span>abc-b s2<span class="racket-paren">)</span> <span class="comment-delimiter">; </span><span class="comment">-&gt; 987</span></pre>

  <p>This works, though you have to repeat the struct type in the
    invocation. That's not so bad, but the bigger problem is that this
    is a macro. The field you wish to update must be known at compile
    time, which makes it awkward to use in the context of higher
    order functions.</p>

  <p>At this point the post is surely sounding pretty whiny. While the
    out-of-the-box experience working with these data structures is
    not great, Racket gives you plenty of power to make things
    better. Probably the most comprehensive take on this I've seen
    is <a href="http://www.greghendershott.com/rackjure/">Rackjure</a>,
    which gives you a lot of the creature comforts I've noted as
    missing above like nicer hash table syntax and data structures you
    can call like functions, as well as a few other niceties
    like <a href="http://www.greghendershott.com/rackjure/index.html#%28part._.Operational_equivalence%29">a
    general-purpose equality predicate</a>[<a href="#fn2">2</a>]
    and <a href="http://www.greghendershott.com/rackjure/index.html#%28part._.Atomic_swap%29">atomic
    swap for boxes</a>.</p>

  <p>In my initial exploration of Racket, I resisted the temptation to
    dive straight into Rackjure in order to give "raw Racket" a fair
    shakedown. Because of this, I've spent more time looking into
    structs and some of the options they provide. Racket has the
    notion
    of <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/createinterface.html">interfaces</a>
    you can conform to in order to get generic functionality
    specialized to a certain struct
    type. <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/dicts.html">Dictionaries</a>
    are one of the interfaces it ships with out of the box, so you can
    use <tt>dict-ref</tt>, <tt>dict-set</tt>, etc with hash-tables and
    other built-in types that conform to this interface. Your typical
    structs won't work with it, but you can declare structs that
    implement it without too much fuss. I've done this with
    my <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/cooper/blob/master/cooper/fstruct.rkt">fstruct</a>
    macro:</p>

  <pre class="code"><span class="racket-paren">(</span>fstruct fabc <span class="racket-paren">(</span>a b c<span class="racket-paren">))</span>
  <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="keyword">define</span> <span class="variable-name">fs</span> <span class="racket-paren">(</span>fabc <span class="racket-selfeval">123</span> <span class="racket-selfeval">234</span> <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="builtin">+</span> <span class="racket-selfeval">345</span> <span class="racket-selfeval">456</span><span class="racket-paren">)))</span>

  <span class="racket-paren">(</span>dict-ref fs <span class="racket-selfeval">'a</span><span class="racket-paren">)</span> <span class="comment-delimiter">; </span><span class="comment">-&gt; 123
  </span><span class="racket-paren">(</span>dict-set fs <span class="racket-selfeval">'b</span> <span class="racket-selfeval">999</span><span class="racket-paren">)</span> <span class="comment-delimiter">; </span><span class="comment">-&gt; (fabc 123 234 801)
  </span><span class="racket-paren">(</span>dict-update fs <span class="racket-selfeval">'c</span> <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="keyword">&#955;</span> <span class="racket-paren">(</span>x<span class="racket-paren">)</span> <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="builtin">-</span> x <span class="racket-selfeval">400</span><span class="racket-paren">)))</span> <span class="comment-delimiter">; </span><span class="comment">-&gt; (fabc 123 234 401)</span></pre>

  <p>One gotcha if you're used to Clojure is that <tt>dict-update</tt>
    is not variadic&mdash;if you provide a fourth argument it will be
    used as a "not found" value rather than as an argument to the
    updater function. <tt>(dict-update fs 'c - 400)</tt> won't
    work. However, unlike Clojure, Racket can do reverse partial
    application, so <tt>(rcurry - 400)</tt> does the job, which is
    nicer than spelling out the lambda form fully.</p>

  <p>Another gotcha is that <tt>dict-update</tt> doesn't appear to
    have a nested equivalent. But that's easy to add:</p>

  <pre class="code"><span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="keyword">define</span> <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="function-name">dict-update-in</span> d ks f . args<span class="racket-paren">)</span>
    <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="racket-paren">(</span>empty? <span class="racket-paren">(</span>rest ks<span class="racket-paren">))</span>
        <span class="racket-paren">(</span>dict-update d <span class="racket-paren">(</span>first ks<span class="racket-paren">)</span> <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="keyword">&#955;</span> <span class="racket-paren">(</span>x<span class="racket-paren">)</span> <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="builtin">apply</span> f x args<span class="racket-paren">)))</span>
        <span class="racket-paren">(</span>dict-set d <span class="racket-paren">(</span>first ks<span class="racket-paren">)</span> <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="builtin">apply</span> dict-update-in
                                      <span class="racket-paren">(</span>dict-ref d <span class="racket-paren">(</span>first ks<span class="racket-paren">))</span>
                                      <span class="racket-paren">(</span>rest ks<span class="racket-paren">)</span> f args<span class="racket-paren">))))</span>

  <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="keyword">define</span> <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="function-name">dict-ref-in</span> d ks<span class="racket-paren">)</span>
    <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="keyword">if</span> <span class="racket-paren">(</span>empty? <span class="racket-paren">(</span>rest ks<span class="racket-paren">))</span>
        <span class="racket-paren">(</span>dict-ref d <span class="racket-paren">(</span>first ks<span class="racket-paren">))</span>
        <span class="racket-paren">(</span>dict-ref-in <span class="racket-paren">(</span>dict-ref d <span class="racket-paren">(</span>first ks<span class="racket-paren">))</span> <span class="racket-paren">(</span>rest ks<span class="racket-paren">))))</span></pre>

  <p>The <tt>fstruct</tt> macro has one more trick up its sleeve. The
    structs it generates are applicable just like Clojure maps:</p>

  <pre class="code"><span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="keyword">define</span> <span class="variable-name">fs2</span> <span class="racket-paren">(</span>fabc <span class="racket-selfeval">123</span> <span class="racket-paren">(</span>fabc <span class="racket-selfeval">234</span> <span class="racket-selfeval">345</span> <span class="racket-paren">(</span>fabc <span class="racket-selfeval">987</span> <span class="racket-selfeval">654</span> <span class="racket-selfeval">321</span><span class="racket-paren">))</span> <span class="racket-selfeval">0</span><span class="racket-paren">))</span>

  <span class="racket-paren">(</span>fs2 <span class="racket-selfeval">'a</span><span class="racket-paren">)</span> <span class="comment-delimiter">; </span><span class="comment">-&gt; 123
  </span><span class="racket-paren">(</span>fs2 '<span class="racket-paren">(</span>b b<span class="racket-paren">))</span> <span class="comment-delimiter">; </span><span class="comment">-&gt; 345
  </span><span class="racket-paren">(</span>fs2 <span class="racket-selfeval">'c</span> <span class="racket-selfeval">9</span><span class="racket-paren">)</span> <span class="comment-delimiter">; </span><span class="comment">-&gt; (fabc 123 (fabc 234 345 (fabc 987 654 321)) 9)
  </span><span class="racket-paren">(</span>fs2 '<span class="racket-paren">(</span>b c a<span class="racket-paren">)</span> <span class="racket-selfeval">0</span><span class="racket-paren">)</span> <span class="comment-delimiter">; </span><span class="comment">-&gt; (fabc 123 (fabc 234 345 (fabc 0 654 321)) 0)</span>
  <span class="racket-paren">(</span>dict-update-in fs2 '<span class="racket-paren">(</span>b b<span class="racket-paren">)</span> <span class="builtin">+</span> <span class="racket-selfeval">555</span><span class="racket-paren">)</span>
  <span class="comment-delimiter">; </span><span class="comment">-&gt; (fabc 123 (fabc 234 900 (fabc 987 654 321)) 0)</span></pre>

  <p>They support nested lookups and setting out of the box, but of
    course for expressing updates that are a function of the old value
    to the new value you'll have to use <tt>dict-update</tt>
    or <tt>dict-update-in</tt>. My primary project at the moment has a
    deeply-nested <tt>state</tt> fstruct that contains hash-tables
    which contain fstructs, so being able to use a
    single <tt>dict-update-in</tt> which operates across multiple
    concrete types is very convenient.</p>

  <p>Finally, while I prefer pure functions for as much of the logic
    as I can, the outer layer requires tracking state and changes to
    it. Racket provides the <tt>box</tt> type for this, which is
    equivalent to the <tt>atom</tt> of Clojure. Unfortunately while it
    provides the same CAS atomicity guarantees, it only exposes this
    via the low-level <tt>box-cas!</tt> function. Oh well,
    functional <tt>swap!</tt> which operates in terms of the old value
    is easy to implement on our own or steal from Rackjure as long as
    you don't care about retries:</p>

  <pre class="code"><span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="keyword">define</span> <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="function-name">swap!</span> <span class="builtin">box</span> f . args<span class="racket-paren">)</span>
    <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="keyword">let</span> <span class="racket-paren">[(</span>old <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="builtin">unbox</span> <span class="builtin">box</span><span class="racket-paren">))]</span>
      <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="builtin">box-cas!</span> <span class="builtin">box</span> old <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="builtin">apply</span> f old args<span class="racket-paren">))))</span>

  <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="keyword">define</span> <span class="variable-name">b</span> <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="builtin">box</span> <span class="racket-selfeval">56</span><span class="racket-paren">))</span>

  <span class="racket-paren">(</span><span class="builtin">box-cas!</span> b <span class="racket-selfeval">56</span> <span class="racket-selfeval">92</span><span class="racket-paren">)</span> <span class="comment-delimiter">; </span><span class="comment">-&gt; b now contains 92
  </span>
  <span class="racket-paren">(</span>swap! b <span class="builtin">+</span> <span class="racket-selfeval">75</span><span class="racket-paren">)</span> <span class="comment-delimiter">; </span><span class="comment">-&gt; b now contains 167</span></pre>

  <p>The <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/cooper">HyperCard
    clone</a> I <a href="/174">wrote about in my last post</a>
    consists of a number of modes that define handlers that can update
    the state based on clicks. The handlers are all functions that
    take and return a <tt>state</tt> fstruct and are called via
    the <tt>swap!</tt> function. This allows the bulk of the code to
    be written in a pure fashion while keeping state change
    constrained to
    only <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/cooper/blob/master/cooper/main.rkt#L51">two
    outer-layer mouse and key handler functions</a>. The actual box
    containing the state never leaves the <tt>main</tt> module.</p>

  <p>Racket has top-notch support for
    <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/data-structure-contracts.html">contracts</a>
    that
    can <a href="https://github.com/technomancy/cooper/blob/master/cooper/cooper.rkt#L55">describe
    the shape of data</a>. In this case rather than attaching
    contracts to functions scattered all over the codebase, I attach
    them only to the box that contains the <tt>state</tt> struct, and
    any time there's a type bug it's usually immediately apparent what
    caused the trouble. While it would be possible to gain more
    certainty about correctness at compile time by
    using <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/ts-guide/index.html">Typed
    Racket</a>, contracts let me define the shape of the data in a
    single place rather than annotating every function that handles
    state.</p>

  <p>While I'd certainly be happy if Racket accomodated some of these
    functional programming idioms in a more streamlined way out of the
    box, it speaks volumes that I was able to make myself quite
    comfortable on my own only a week or two after beginning with the
    language[<a href="#fn3">3</a>]. It's interesting to note that all
    of the places in which Clojure has the edge[<a href="#fn4">4</a>]
    over Racket (with the conspicuous exception of equality) lie
    around succinctness and greater expressivity, while Racket's
    advantages are all around improved correctness and making mistakes
    easier to prevent and detect.</p>

  <hr />

  <p>[<a name="fn1">1</a>] It's possible to perform evaluation inside hash literal
    syntax by using backticks: <tt>`#hash((a . ,(+ 5 6 7))</tt> does
    what you expect. It's better than nothing, but that's a lot of
    noise to express a simple concept.</p>

  <p>[<a name="fn2">2</a>] I've blogged about <a href="/159">why egal
    is such a great equality predicate</a>. Racket ships with a
    bewildering array of equality functions, but in functional code
    you really only need this one (sadly absent from the core
    language) for 98% of what you do.</p>

  <p>[<a name="fn3">3</a>] With one exception: Racket's macro system
    is rather intimidating coming from Clojure. Its additional
    complexity allows it to support some neat things, but so far I
    haven't gotten to the point where I'd understand why I'd want to
    do those kinds of things. In any case, I got help
    from <a href="http://www.greghendershott.com/">Greg
    Hendershott</a> to turn the <tt>fstruct</tt> macro into something
    properly hygenic.</p>

  <p>[<a name="fn4">4</a>] This ignores the advantages conferred by
    the respective implementations&mdash;Clojure has significantly
    better performance and access to libraries, while Racket's
    compiler/debugger/editor tools are much more polished, and its
    resource consumption is dramatically lower.</p>
