  <p>Overheard on #emacs: </p>
  
  <pre class='irc'>
   *** desolator JOIN 
   [desolator] vii ROCKS!
   *** desolator PART #emacs
   [technomancy] is that the sequel to vi?
   [inkedmn] no,  it's vi for the nintendo wii
   [inkedmn] : p
  [...]
   *** desolator JOIN 
   [desolator] er
   [desolator] vi,  sorry
   [technomancy] maybe he was talking about final fantasy vii
   [technomancy] in which case he was absolutely correct

  <p>Also,  today is <a

  Day</a> according to Wikipedia.</p>
  
  <p>While we're in quoting/linking mode,  James Shore has an <a
  href="http: //www.jamesshore.com/Blog/CardMeeting/Voluntary-Technical-Debt.html">interesting
  article on technical debt</a>. It's worth reading and trying to keep in mind.</p>
  
  <p>Last but not least--I've improved the rhtml-mode for Rails Emacs
  hacking with some help from pstickne on #emacs. It's not quite ready
  for a 1.0 release,  but if you have been itching for better rhtml
  support and don't mind playing with prerelease-quality software,  <a
  href="http: //dev.technomancy.us/phil/browser/dotfiles/.emacs.d/rinari/rhtml-mode.el">go
  right ahead</a>. There should be more Emacs/Rails goodness coming 
  soon; getting the last few bugs worked out of rhtml-mode was very
  tricky.</p>
