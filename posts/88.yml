  <p>The hike I took with my wife earlier today has <a href='http://maps.google.com/?q=http://technomancy.us/static/edwards.kml'>entered the 21st century</a>. Or something.</p>

  <p>Lazyweb request:  I wanted to make it so the image appears in the bubble rather than just the link,  but it doesn't seem to be easy to do with KML. Is there something I'm missing?</p>
