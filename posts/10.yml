  <p> Funny Story:  at RubyConf we had just come back from <a href='http://www.rubys.com'>Ruby's Diner</a> the <a href='http://jroller.com/page/obie?entry=matz_wild_and_crazy_keynote'>keynote</a> was about to start. I was wearing a paper hat I had gotten at Ruby's,  and it was getting a lot of comments. Then a Japanese fellow sat down next to me,  started talking to me,  and took a photo. The thing is,  this fellow looked a great deal like Matz. (creator of Ruby) I was pretty excited,  thinking I had the chance to talk with someone famous.</p> <p> Anyway,  after we had been talking for about five minutes the real Matz got up and gave his keynote,  and I realized he wasn't the guy I was talking to. I don't mean to offend this man--we had an interesting talk&mdash;but I was a little disappointed. While I know they probably really don't look much alike,  to a ang-mo^Wgaijin like myself they could be long-lost brothers. <i>Update</i>: It wasn't actually Koichi, the person in this photo, but I couldn't find a photo of the right person. </p> <p><a href='http://www.ok-cancel.com/comic/2.html'>This</a> made me laugh for a long time.</p>
