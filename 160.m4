<p>I just got a new laptop, and while I wouldn't post about it
  normally I've had a number of people ask me what I thought of it.
  For the last five years or so I've been a Thinkpad user
  exclusively, but the latest models of their lightweight X series
  have offered disappointing screens with 1366x786 being the only
  resolution option. Since my dignity prevents me from buying a
  laptop with fewer vertical pixels than my phone, I broadened my
  search this time around and came across the 13-inch Samsung Series
  9, aka NP900X3B.</p>

<p><b>Update August 2012:</b> I've gone back to the old Thinkpad after
  getting it repaired. I realized after a month or so with the
  Samsung that the ultra-thin profile is actually an anti-feature. I
  like my laptops small, but I realized that weight is really the
  only thing I care about in that category. There are no concrete
  benefits to be had from a thin design, while fact that it forces a
  shallow, uncomfortable keyboard, inaccessible battery, less-sturdy
  chassis, and hard-wired SSD are very tangible drawbacks. I
  definitely do miss the brilliant screen, but I'm glad to be on a
  machine that doesn't sacrifice functionality for looks. If you're
  considering a Series 9, I'd still say it's better than most
  laptops on the market. If you're coming from a Macbook, the
  keyboard and inaccessible battery might not bother you, but I'd
  encourage you to take a look at the Thinkpad X series too.</p>

<p>At first the most striking thing about it is its thin profile,
  but once you've started using it you realize it's the screen that
  really sets it apart. Samsung is the largest manufacturer of LCDs
  in the world, so it makes sense that the screen would be the
  distinguishing factor on their high-end models. The resolution is
  1600x900, which I couldn't find in anything else smaller than 14
  inches, but it's the 400 cd/m<sup>2</sup> of brightness that
  really sets it apart. With summer right around the corner, this
  perfect
  for <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/technomancy/tags/remoteoffice/">working
  outdoors</a>.</p>

<p>While I'm pretty thrilled with the new machine, the thin profile
  forces some difficult compromises with the keyboard. It's of the
  standard chicklet design, which is a drag coming from the
  Thinkpad. The X200s Thinkpad I was using previously had a very
  comfortable response and depth to it that you don't find with
  most chicklet keyboards. The Samsung also lacks a trackpoint, drainage
  tray, and dedicated volume buttons. The X200s isn't appreciably
  heavier than the Samsung; (only Â½ a pound more) but it is over
  twice as thick. Personally if it's light enough I don't find
  thickness to be a problem; I'd much rather have a comfortable
  keyboard than a 0.4-inch profile. But it does turn heads.</p>

<p>The speakers on ultraportable laptops like the X200s typically
  come across as a token effort to fill a feature checkbox, but the
  Samsung's are fairly respectable. I was pleased to see the lack of
  the hardware wifi kill switch that plagued me on my Thinkpad. It's
  also got a bigger selection of ports than you'd expect with the
  slim profile: USB 2, USB 3, micro-HDMI, combined mic/headphones,
  and Ethernet, though the latter must be used with the provided
  adapter.</p>

<p>I'm running Debian Wheezy on it because I
  read <a href="http://www.ing.unitn.it/~zatelli/linux/samsung.html">on
  a blog post</a> that a newer kernel was needed for the wifi
  drivers, but apparently this was only the case with an earlier
  model of the Series 9 that used the Broadcom chipset; The NP900X3B
  uses an Intel chipset that has been well-supported for some time.
  Everything worked perfectly out of the box except the keys for
  adjusting the keyboard backlight. The camera, external monitor
  port, and multitouch trackpad work as you'd expect. The suspend
  functionality, which on Linux has traditionally lagged behind Mac
  OS X, resumes in a couple short seconds.</p>

<p>While I would love to see this same screen on a laptop with the
  luxurious keyboard, carbon fiber body, and replaceable battery of a
  Thinkpad, the Series 9 is quite slick and should keep me happy for a
  number of years.</p>
