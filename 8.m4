<p> I was going to list all the instances today when I had an 'aha!' moment about a new Ruby feature that makes it <a href='http://gigamonkeys.com/book/functions.html'>more like Lisp</a>. Problem is,  it's happening too often. I lost track. (When are we getting cons? caadr?)</p> <img src='/i/rubysworld.jpg' alt='Rubys World' title='The Future of Programming' /> <p> Matz just finished his keynote,  which caused <kbd>#rubyconf</kbd> to erupt.  Who would have thought a new lambda syntax would elicit such a barrage of heckling^Wcommentry? I personally think <code>lambda (args) { body }</code> is the way to go,  but it should also be given a convenience method to save on typing. Isn't that what Akira said yesterday? <a href='http://jutopia.tirsen.com/'>Jon Tirsen</a> has <a href='http://jutopia.tirsen.com/articles/2005/10/15/rubyconf-day-1'>a good wrap-up</a> from yesterday's Matz QA&mdash;he'll probably have today's up at some point as well. </p>
