<p>Oh,  and somehow I forgot to mention this,  but <b>comments</b>,  people!</p>

<p>I cooked up a little anti-spam magic inspired by <a href='http://pastie.caboo.se'>Pastie</a>,  so I'm not going to be afraid anymore! Of course,  I'm subscribed to its <a href='http://technomancy.us/blog/comments'>feed</a> now,  so if anything stinky does start to happen,  I'm totally going to be on top of things.</p>
