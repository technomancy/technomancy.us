    <p>So,  what's up? I've added tagging to my blog,  keeping the LOC under 60,  which is cool.</p>
<p>Chris Blizzard has <a href='http://www.0xdeadbeef.com/?p=171'>an insightful post on Free Software in India and how their perspective on IT affects their participation</a>. A good read.</p>
<p>Also,  I'm playing around a bit with the <a href='http://sawmill.sourceforge.net'>Sawfish window manager</a> as per some advice on #ruby-lang. Not that there's anything wrong with Metacity,  but my interest was piqued since it seemed to be the kind of thing that could improve the way you work on a very fundamental level. Sawfish is basically the emacs of window managers,  which is to say it's super-extensible and written in Lisp.</p> </p>Apparently Lisp is like crack&mdash;one hit (emacs) just leaves you wanting more.</p>
