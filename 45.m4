  	   <p>So I was reading <a href='http://planet.lisp.org'>Planet 	   Lisp</a> the other day,  and I came across <a 	   href='http://lemonodor.com/archives/001382.html'>Lemonodor's 	   post on Startup School</a>. In it he mentions how attendees 	   were able to keep notes via <a 	   href='http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/'>SubEthaEdit</a>. 	   </p> 	    	   <p>Now,  I had a rather mixed response to this. The 	   pragmatist in me thought,  "Oh,  cool; they were able to take 	   more comprehensive notes on the event with this neat piece 	   of collaborative software." The idealist in me thought,  	   "Wait,  this is bad; it increases reliance on software that 	   is not only closed,  but is developed by people who are <a 	   href='http://crschmidt.livejournal.com/259345.html'>openly hostile</a> to users' freedom to interoperate." Finally,  the 	   pragmatist in me came around,  "Oh crap,  if <b>I</b> were 	   there,  I wouldn't have been able to take part in this. No good!"</p> 	    	   <p>So,  with the help of the excellent <a 	   href='http://darcs.0x539.de/trac/obby/cgi-bin/trac.cgi/wiki/ObbyProtocol'>Obby 	   protocol</a>,  the dynamic power of Emacs Lisp,  and some 	   spare hacking time in the past three days,  I've come up 	   with <a 	   href='http://dev.technomancy.us/phil/wiki/ebby'>Ebby</a>,  a 	   library that allows Emacs to collaboratively edit documents 	   in a synchronized way. It doesn't have a shiny icon,  but I 	   hope you give it a shot.</p> 	    	   <p>Note that Ebby only runs as a client; you'll have to get 	   <a href='http://darcs.0x539.de/'>Gobby</a> to run as a 	   server to connect to. Ebby connects to Gobby version 0.3,  	   which seems to be the latest stable version at the time of 	   this writing. If you can't install Gobby,  (or just don't 	   feel like it) you can try connecting to my server at 	   technomancy.us,  but there's no guarantee that it will be 	   running at all times.</p> 	    	   <p>So please try it out and add your comments to 	   <a href='http://dev.technomancy.us/phil/wiki/ebby'>the 	   wiki</a>. Don't be shy about <a 	   href='http://dev.technomancy.us/phil/newticket'>filing 	   tickets for any problems or patches you may have</a>.</p> 	    	   <p><b>Update</b>:  critical bug fixed; please <a href='http://dev.technomancy.us/phil/browser/dotfiles/.emacs.d/ebby.el'>grab a fresh copy</a>!</p> <p><b>Update</b>: Ebby has not been updated for the changes in more recent versions of Obby, but <a href='http://rudel.sourceforge.net/'>Rudel</a> has, so try that instead.</p>
