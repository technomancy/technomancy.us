<p>Well,  A and I
  have <a href='http://philisha.net/2007/03/big-news/'>been in
    Indonesia</a> now for two weeks. We are really enjoying it; see
  <a href='http://philisha.net'>the other blog</a> for details.</p>

<p>My task here has been training the team here and setting up the
  necessary technical infrastructure. First off was
  installing <a href='http://releases.ubuntu.com'>Feisty Fawn</a>
  (which was serendipitiously released this last Thursday) on a server
  and configuring basic services on that. Previously they have been a
  Microsoft-heavy shop with a bit of PHP,  but they are very eager to
  migrate away from that towards a more flexible,  cost-effective
  platform. The best part about this is that not only does it save a
  lot of money,  it also sets the programmers up to be contributors to
  the global software community rather than simply being
  consumers.</p>

<p>So in addition to the install-fest side of things,  I've done some
  presentations to get the developers up to speed on important
  topics. The first was a "beginning Rails" brief introduction. It's
  not enough to really get a start coding,  but it was enough to whet
  the appetite and make them wish they didn't have to finish up their
  projects in PHP. Enthusiasm is great.</p>

<p>The other presentation is an overview of how to use Trac and
  Subversion to collaborate on projects. It's kind of hard to
  introduce something as fundamental as version control to people
  unfamiliar with it since it's so easy to take things like that for
  granted and hard to approach it from a fresh perspective. Still, 
  getting those habits in place is very important.</p>

<p>I've uploaded <a href='/code/presentations.tar.gz'>the code for the
  presentations</a>. There's not really enough in the slides alone to
  learn from; they rely heavily on a narrator. Still,  they could come
  in handy to someone else in a similar position. Presenting to a
  group is tricky; there are a lot of factors to take into
  account. It's important to know your audience level and find ways to
  keep them engaged. (I wish I had used more images in the Trac
  presentation.)  It's been a lot of fun,  and I've learned a lot about
  how to do this kind of thing,  though I'm looking forward to getting
  into more of the day-to-day coding rather than all this high-level
  stuff.</p>
