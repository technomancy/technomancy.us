<p>Oh yeah,  I almost forgot to mention this. I've teamed up with
  with <a href='http://funkworks.blogspot.com'>Forrest Chang</a> to
  focus on polishing Emacs' Rails support. I've written
  up <a href='http://technomancy.us/article/emacsrails'>a tutorial</a>
  (still in progress),  and there's
  a <a
  href='http://dev.technomancy.us/phil/wiki/EmacsRailsTutorial'>discussion
  page</a> on my wiki where you can have your say. Forrest is
  planning on putting up some nifty screencasts,  so stay tuned.</p>

<p>Also,  <a href='http://planet.caboo.se'>Planet Caboose</a> is all official now.</p>

<p>Lastly,  <a href='http://xkcd.com/c73.html'>this web comic</a> is pretty funny.</p>
