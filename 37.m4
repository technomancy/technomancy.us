<p>Today I have two Planet-related items of business.</p> <p>Imagine my surprise when I found out I had been added to <a href='http://planetruby.0x42.net/'>Planet Ruby</a>. Planet Ruby was actually one of my main motivations to write <a href='http://rubyforge.org/projects/rplanet'>rPlanet</a>. Maybe as soon as I can get it a little more polished I'll try to see if I can convince Planet Ruby to move away from Python. I'm still a little star-struck to be listed up there with the &uuml;ber-hackers,  and thus I don't want my code to be used until it's Good.</p>
<p>The other thing is that I finally got my crontab working for <a href='http://hagelb.org/railsconf'>Planet RailsConf</a>,  so I thought I'd just  throw that out there. If you're going to RailsConf,  you can <a href='http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/RailsConfPlanet'>add your name to the roster</a> and you'll start showing up on there too. I'm using Planet RailsConf along with <a href='http://planet.philisha.net'>Planet Zacchaeus</a> (friends of mine) as a playground for doing new things with rPlanet.</p>
