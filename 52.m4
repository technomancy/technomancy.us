<p>OK,  so I haven't been doing anything at all noteworthy recently,  so today's a sort of quote-and-link day.</p>

<p class='irc'>
technoweenie:  whats a linked list?<br />
technoweenie:  @arr << @elem ?<br />
technoweenie:  matz can pdi</p>

<p>I found a great <a
href='http://lizrevision.com/sms-shorthand-for-geeks-using-server-response-codes.html'>list
of how to use HTTP response codes in your daily life</a> that had me
laughing uncontrollably.</p>

<p>I've done a few minor improvements on <a
href='http://concour.se'>Concourse</a> with <a
href='http://arko.net'>Andre</a>,  but there's nothing too
exciting. I'll post here once we've finished the final elusive feature
of being able to choose meeting times that exclude certain attendees.</p><p> I did set up <a href='http://technomancy.us/caboose/index.html'>Planet Caboose</a>,  which may be of interest to some. Don't laugh at the design; I've got dc allegedly working on it.</p>
