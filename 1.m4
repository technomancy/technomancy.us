<p> This is my new blog. I've decided I should split up by blog into a personal life-related blog and a more technical blog. I have tried before to separate tech stuff from my normal blog,  but it was never much of a success. Anyway,  this is where I post crazy tech stuff I'm thinking about&mdash;hence the term Technomancy.</p>
<p> First thought:  Lisp. It's awesome. It's mind-blowing. And there's a <a href='http://gigamonkeys.com/book'>really good book</a> on it available for free. I'm using <a href='http://clisp.cons.org'>CLisp</a> to write the server this blog is running on,  with help from code by <a href='http://www.flownet.com/gat/'>Ron Garret</a>. You can <a href='http://dev.technomancy.us/trac.cgi/browser/durendal/'>see the code</a> on my Trac.</p>
