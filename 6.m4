<p> News: </p> <ul> <li>Just left for <a href='http://rubyconf.org'>RubyConf</a>! Should be quite an exciting event. This is probably the geekiest thing I've ever done,  and I don't expect to surpass it any time soon. I'll be rubbing shoulders with some high-profile <a href='http://www.rubygarden.org/ruby?RubyConf2005Facebook'>folks</a>.</li> <li>Ubuntu's latest release,  <a href='http://www.ubuntulinux.org/download/'>Breezy Badger</a> 5.10 just came out today. I've installed it,  and I'm quite happy. Lots of slick improvements. One of the most intriguing things is the addition of an OEM installer mode,  which will hopefully boost sales of preinstalled Ubuntu boxen. The other changes are pretty subtle&mdash;especially hard for me to notice since I've been running Breezy for a while.</li> <li>Paul Graham has a <a href='http://paulgraham.com/sfp.html'>nice write-up summary</a> of how the Summer Founders Program went. It's very intriguing to see what he's doing and what drives him now that he's essentially "made it".</li> </ul>
