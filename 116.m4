<p>So it turns out <a href='http://rubyconf.org/talks/74'>the Seattle.rb talk</a> that was proposed half-in-jest got accepted for RubyConf 08. The talk is called "Seattle.rb Rules", and will feature a number of prestigious members discussing their projects that they work on at hack night. I've got about ten minutes to fill up for my part, and according to the proposal I'll be speaking on the following:</p>
<blockquote>Phil Hagelberg will talk about <a href='http://bus-scheme.rubyforge.org'>Bus Scheme</a>, which is a Scheme implementation that is implemented (mostly) on the bus. Phil will explore what it's like to implement an interpreter in Ruby and what kinds of things Bus Scheme could be used for.</blockquote>
<p>I'm thinking I may end up talking about something else though. Ideas include "Enough Lisp so that you won't make a Fool of yourself when the Subject comes up at Parties" and "First-class Syntax Modifications: the Final Step Ruby could take to catch up to Lisp".</p>
<p>Any other ideas? What would the average Rubyist want to know about Bus Scheme? <strike>Leave a comment if you've got something to say.</strike></p>
<p><b>Update</b>: Just finished the talk; went pretty well. The other speakers were awesome as well; be sure to catch it on Confreaks when the video goes up. My slides are <a href='/misc/bus_slides.tar.gz'>available for download</a>. The <a href='http://rubyconf2008.confreaks.com/seattlerb-rocks.html'>video is also available</a>.</p>
