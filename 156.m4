<p>I'm lucky to have the chance to do my job remotely from wherever
  I like. Half the time I work out
  of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/technomancy/tags/laboratory">my
  code lab</a>, which is a converted shed in my back yard. But I
  venture out fairly frequently to local coffee shops. Here are a
  few of my favourites. I should mention that I'm a big fan of
  single-origin pour-over brews, so the list is biased in favour of
  places which serve that well rather than the more traditional
  espresso drinks. All these have at least one location in North
  Seattle.</p>

<h4><a href="http://neptunecoffee.com">Neptune</a></h4>

<p>I'm here a lot because it's the only one on this list I don't
  need to get on the freeway for. The decor is a bit sparse, but
  they're quite friendly here and serve a mean pour-over. They've
  been known to even
  serve <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbqJKDZNyic">syphon-brewed
  coffee</a>, which is always a treat to watch when they fire up the
  bunsen burner. The proprietor also
  runs <a href="http://tehcoffee.com/">tehcoffee.com</a>, a
  (Heroku-hosted) site for competition-level baristas can rank and
  review others. The Greenwood neighborhood is great too; lots of
  lunch options and bookstores to browse. Bonus fact: Allie, the
  inventor
  of <a href="http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html">the
  mythical Alot beast</a> has a blend here named after her.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.milsteadandco.com/">Milstead & Co.</a></h4>

<p>This one has only opened relatively recently, but it's made a
  splash for a number of things, not the least of which is the
  spectacular waterfront view from under the Aurora bridge. The
  selection here is excellent; this is the only place on this list
  that serves beans from multiple roasters, and they offer plenty of
  variety in brewing methods. The interior is spacious with high
  ceilings; it's very inviting. Mr. Milstead himself is usually
  around, and his excitement about his craft is infectious and
  obvious once you get him talking. I'd be here all the time if it
  weren't the furthest (south) from where I live.</p>

<h4><a href="http://zokacoffee.com">Zoka</a></h4>

<p>This one is my go-to place. I often run into people I know here,
  (and sometimes <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/">people I
  don't</a>), and we hold
  the <a href="http://seajure.github.com">Seattle Clojure group</a>
  meetings here as well. The University District location in
  particular works well for meetings just because it's so spacious;
  I don't think I've ever seen a larger coffee shop. It's a popular
  place for students to study, so it's pretty quiet in the back. It
  can be crowded at times though, probably based on the school
  schedule. They've got a great selection sourced from all over the
  world that rotates every so often. It's always fun to
  read <a href="http://www.zokacoffee.com/blog/2011/03/jeffs-trip-to-nicaragua.html">their
  blog posts about traveling to visit the growers</a>. The "Zoka
  bars" they serve here are a ridiculously rich treat. The decor
  here is very warm and comfortable with wood paneling
  everywhere.</p>

<img src="i/trabant.jpg" alt="trabant" align="left" />

<h4><a href="http://trabantcoffee.com">Trabant</a></h4>

<p>I don't come here often because the parking situation is awful,
  but if you are in the area (or taking the bus), definitely check
  out Trabant. They've got good chai, but the thing that keeps
  bringing me back here is
  the <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/drink/2008/03/could_a_coffee_maker_be_worth_11000.html">Clover
  machine</a>. This contraption is capable of extracting rich
  flavours out of a bean like nothing else. Unfortunately Starbucks
  purchased the company that sold them, so there aren't very many
  places with Clovers that offer good beans. (As the owner of
  Trabant said about the acquisition, "wearing Air Jordans doesn't
  make you play like Michael Jordan.") Anyway, the downtown Trabant
  is very spare, minimalist, and quiet, while the one in the
  University district (pictured) is bustling and quirky.</p>

<h4>Honorable Mentions</h4>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="http://www.espressovivace.com/">Vivace</a></dt>
  <dd>I'm of the opinion that Vivace has the best espresso in
    Seattle. It's too far for me to visit regularly, but members of
    the famed
    <a href="http://seattlerb.org">Seattle Ruby Brigade</a> can
    often be found working here in the afternoon.</dd>

  <dt><a href="http://www.seattlecoffeeworks.com/">Seattle Coffee Works</a></dt>
  <dd>I've only been here a couple times, but I was floored by their
    Yirgacheffe both times. They serve their pour-overs at a
    separate "slow bar" where the baristas are happy to geek out
    over their creations if you show interest. Again, this one's too
    far away (Pike St.) to make me a regular. <b>Update</b>: they've
    got a location in Ballard too.</dd>

  <dt><a href="http://www.greenbeancoffee.org/">Green Bean</a></dt>
  <dd>This one is actually a non-profit which supports a number of
    other non-profits on a rotating basis. The staff here are really
    friendly. I like to come here early and get breakfast with my
    family since they've got a kids' corner.</dd>

  <dt><a href="http://www.chocolati.com/">Chocolati</a></dt>
  <dd>I don't even come here for their coffee, but their hot
    chocolate is superb. They've also got great truffles. The
    Greenwood location is a converted house that offers plenty of
    space to work, while the Greenlake location is a lot smaller but
    has nice views of the water.</dd>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
