<p> I work for a company developing a remote vehicle communication system. We are using Rails to set up a web interface to it. We need an experienced programmer to come help us out. You should have launched at least one Rails project and should be comfortable working with a team that is geographically scattered. You'll also need to be experienced with using Ruby (outside of just Rails) and Javascript. </p> <p> The main thing we are looking for is simply that you have gone through the process of launching a web application and have the skills necessary to prioritize and manage the project. </p> <p> This would ideally be a full-time job. Location is not an issue. </p> <p> Other skills that would be helpful include Linux server administration (lighttpd,  postgresql) and experience with Trac and Subversion. </p> <p> If you think you are qualified,  send an email to philh@paxtel.com with your resume. </p>
