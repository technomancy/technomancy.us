  <p>It all comes together:  <cite>it is a matter of debate,  however,  whether the distinction between resources and their representations is too Platonic for practical use on the web,  though it is popular in the RDF community.</cite>(<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer'>Wikipedia on REST</a>)</p> <p><cite>Backpack actually does reuse controller actions for separate clients. It has a mobile version,  an API version,  and a regular web version. And about 80% of the actions for all three are shared across through various hacks.</cite>(<a href='http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000572.html'> DHH on HTTP-Accept</a>)</p> <p>And there you have it.
