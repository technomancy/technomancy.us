<p> RubyConf is officially over. It was pretty much amazing. I haven't ever brushed elbows with so much brilliance. My only regret is that I didn't meet more people and introduce myself more. I know it'll only be more difficult next year when there are <a href='http://blog.curthibbs.us/articles/2005/10/16/rubyconf-2005-was-amazing'>over 500</a> attendees. Exponential growth,  right? It is quite nice to be home back with my wife,  but it was a bummer to have to leave. </p> <p> To cheer me up,  it's been raining. Also,  the project that <a href='http://joelmwatson.com/blog'>Joel</a> and I have been working on,  <a href='http://rplanet.rubyforge.org'>RPlanet</a>,  has been getting some notice,  including a <a href='http://redhanded.hobix.com/cult/rubyconf2005keynote.html'>mention on RedHanded</a>. That was pretty exciting for my first personal Ruby project. Joel and I had it nearly equivalent with <a href='http://planetplanet.org'>the original Python-implemented Planet</a> within the first day (minus the ultra-liberality of its feed parser), and by the second day were working on one-upping it with comment feeds. (Actually,  Joel was working on that; I was busy with <a href='http://www.rubys.com'>trademark violations</a> in the CSS.)</p> <p> I was just shocked and horrified (ok,  I was neither shocked nor horrified,  merely disappointed) that <a href='http://planetruby.0x42.net/'>Planet Ruby</a> was running on (python) Planet. Hopefully they'll switch once RPlanet gets a little more robust. At least <a href='http://planetrubyonrails.com'>Planet Rails</a> is written in Rails, but I was never too impressed with that site. Its subscription to the wiki feed was a real pain, there was downtime all over the place,  and it just felt over-engineered. (Why does an aggregator need a database?) Anyway,  I hope to have an RPlanet rubyforge page up and make it a gem eventually. So much to do! </p>
