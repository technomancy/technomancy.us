<p>Oh noes&mdash;I've
  been <a
  href="http://metaatem.net/2007/02/12/5-thingz-u-didnt-no-bout-me">hit</a>. The
  inimitable Erik Kastner smacked me with an obligation to reveal five
  "little-known" facts about myself. Normally I don't comply with this
  sort of thing,  but Kastner's a good fellow... I didn't want to let
  him down. It may be a bit duller than his,  but keep in mind this
  wasn't my idea.

<ol>
  <li>I was caught in a flash flood hiking in a ravine in the
  mountains of Indonesia. We had just finished climbing (tumbling?
  scampering? There's a word for it...) about the boulders at the
  ravine's head and started for home when we were pursued by a
  torrent of muddy water.</li>
  <li>I got drafted into the basketball team in high school because of
  my height. I didn't stand a chance; it was decided behind my back
  from the very day I visited the school as a prospective student. I
  later found out that a few students stood up for me:  "What if he
  doesn't want to be a basketball player? What if he wants to be a
  chef?" It didn't help,  but it did earn me the nickname "The Chef"
  for a brief while. I was terrible at basketball.</li>
  <li>I witnessed an attempted attack on
  the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_wall">Western
  Wall</a> in Jerusalem. I was above the plaza looking out at the city
  and saw someone make a break from the checkpoint to the crowds at
  the wall. He didn't looked armed,  but he had a bag with him. He was
  apprehended before he got 5m away from the security checkpoint.</li>
  <li>I got my start in programming on QBasic for DOS in 7th grade. I
  wrote a couple cool games,  but I thought I should move on to
  something more serious and started learning C and CodeWarrior. I
  always thought the sheer amount of additional effort necessary to
  get something decent working in a GUI environment turned me off
  programming until university,  but now I'm thinking it had more to do
  with people. I had a few friends who enjoyed QBasic,  and I had
  nobody to work with on C stuff. It didn't help that I thought "real"
  programming had to be GUI-related and a huge pain,  and that only
  "kids' stuff" was easy and fun.</li>
  <li>I've dislocated both my shoulders multiple times.  You can make
  me quiver in discomfort by merely talking about shoulders the
  various joint-related problems which can happen to them. Please
  don't.</li>
</ol>

<p>I suppose the traditional thing to do here is pass on the meme to others: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/ErBot">fsbot</a></li>
  <li><a
  href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/BirnyTheBot">birny</a></li>
  <li>corundum</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately they haven't gotten back to me on that.</p>
