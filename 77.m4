  <p>My most recent Rails project has been fairly interesting to me
  because it's the most structured of any project I've ever
  done. Every week there's a conference call between the development
  team and the clients in which we demo all the work that we've done
  in the past week,  bring any questions of direction or specifics
  before the client,  and discuss what area the next week's development
  should cover. There's probably a fancy agile name for this
  methodology,  but we kind of just go with what works for us.</p>

  <p>This has had a number of unexpected benefits. For one thing,  it
  brings a good level of focus. When you commit to taking a feature
  for the next week,  you need to think about exactly what that entails
  and how much you can take on in that time. You have to know your
  limits. It encourages you to build features in small increments
  since you have to go all the way from database migrations to UI and
  HTML views (and occasionally even Javascript enhancements,  although
  that can usually wait) all in a single week. I found this to be very
  helpful both in terms of helping me focus on the task at hand and in
  terms of thinking about the feature itself. When there isn't much
  time between the initial discussion of a feature and the writing of
  its UI,  it's easier to consider its impact upon the users. If your
  initial idea had some flaws,  they can be discovered much more quickly
  than they would otherwise be.</p>

  <p>Every week since I thought of it I've written out everything that
  the week's demo will cover. I've found it's helpful to write out
  exactly the steps you're going to take to demonstrate the new
  functionality. Any small questions that can wait for the demo are
  noted in the margins,  as is a list of initial plans for what you
  will take next week. It's also great to have paper in front of you
  during the call so if there's a small fix you need to do you can
  just jot it in the margins.</p>

  <p>I've found myself to be more or less terrible at time estimating
  in the past,  but the structured nature of this project means I'm
  constantly thinking about how long things have taken in previous
  iterations and how I should consider future features in the light of
  this. I've never had such a small feedback loop before,  so I think
  this experience will go along way towards improving my estimating
  skills in the future. Being able to go back over the demo sheets also
  gives me a concrete record of what was done in each iteration,  which
  is a handy reference.</p>

  <p>Thinking in small discrete steps is great.</p>
