<p> New features:  <a href='/feed/atom'>feed</a> and a search provided by Google. It's great:  hoodwink.d saves me from having to code comments,  and Google does search for me. Now I see why people are so excited about outsourcing.</p> <p> I saw <a href='http://www.identity20.com/media/OSCON2005/'>a nifty presentation</a> from <a href='http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/'>OSCON</a> the other day on what identity means and how that can be conveyed via technology. The presentation style alone is worth watching: it's very vibrant and active,  totally avoiding the <a href='http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/ppt2.html'>Powerpoint Syndrome</a> and getting an interesting point across.</p>
