<p>This is too perfect&mdash;<a href='http://pragprog.com'>The Pragmatic Programmers</a> are publishing short, cheap PDF e-books focused on small topics. While <a href='http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi/Random/Fridays.html'>the first book</a> is not too exciting for me (I'm a GTK man myself), the next releases mentioned are all areas I'm very interested in. Kudos to the Pragmatic Programmers for breaking the rules of publishing <a href='http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000487.html'>again</a>.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and it's funny that the tenative cover for a book on <a href='http://www.kde.org/whatiskde/qt.php'>QT</a> programming looks suspiciously like the <a href='http://www.gnome.org'>GNOME</a> logo.</p>
