<p>Overheard on #emacs: </p>

<pre class='irc'>
 *** desolator JOIN 
 [desolator] vii ROCKS!
 *** desolator PART #emacs
 [technomancy] is that the sequel to vi?
 [inkedmn] no,  it's vi for the nintendo wii
 [inkedmn] : p
[...]
 *** desolator JOIN 
 [desolator] er
 [desolator] vi,  sorry
 [technomancy] maybe he was talking about final fantasy vii
 [technomancy] in which case he was absolutely correct

<p>Also,  today is <a

Day</a> according to Wikipedia.</p>

<p>While we're in quoting/linking mode,  James Shore has an <a
href="http://www.jamesshore.com/Blog/CardMeeting/Voluntary-Technical-Debt.html">interesting
article on technical debt</a>. It's worth reading and trying to keep in mind.</p>

<p>Last but not least&mdash;I've improved the rhtml-mode for Rails Emacs
hacking with some help from pstickne on #emacs. It's not quite ready
for a 1.0 release,  but if you have been itching for better rhtml
support and don't mind playing with prerelease-quality software,  <a
href="http://dev.technomancy.us/phil/browser/dotfiles/.emacs.d/rinari/rhtml-mode.el">go
right ahead</a>. There should be more Emacs/Rails goodness coming 
soon; getting the last few bugs worked out of rhtml-mode was very
tricky.</p>
