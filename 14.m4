<p> What constitutes good music for coding?  </p>
<p> Music without vocals helps. Vocals in a foreign language aren't so bad,  since they can be tuned out more easily. (Stereolab,  Kraftwerk) There's something about music with an emphasized beat that helps me stay focused. (Freezepop,  VNV Nation,  Magnetic Fields) I'm not sure how that works. Game soundtracks are often good. (Black Mages,  Chrono Cross,  Halo) </p>
